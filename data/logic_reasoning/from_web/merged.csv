Rather, the same people who bought the manuscript copies simply bought more of the printed books.(D) No. This is irrelevant.(E) No. Although this may be true, the argument claims there was a drastic jump in the literacy rate after the printing press was invented._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More This is a weaken question.We have to weaken the conclusion that there was an increase in the number of people who could read in intial years of printing.(A) During the first years after the invention of the printing press, letter writing by people who wrote without the assistance of scribes or clerks exhibited a dramatic increase.This strengthens the conclusion by saying that letter writing without assistance of scribes/clerks increased.(B) Books produced on the printing press are often found with written comments in the margins in the handwriting of the people who owned the books.Irrelevant. Does not affect the conclusion in any way.(C) In the first years after the printing press was invented, printed books were purchased primarily by people who had always bought and read expensive manuscripts but could afford a greater number of printed books for the same money.It provides another reason to the dramatic increase in the demand. If the people who could read started buying more books then it explains the increased demand is not due to the increase in the number of people who could read. Hence WEAKENS the conclusion.(D) Books that were printed on the printing press in the first years after its invention often circulated among friends in informal reading clubs or libraries.If books were circulated in reading clubs or libraries, it might strengthen the argument that the no of readers has increased.(E) The first printed books published after the invention of the printing press would have been useless to illiterate people, since the books had virtually no illustrations.Irrelevant.Hence C. +C.Conclusion is that the increase in the no. of books purchased is because of the increase in the number of people who learned to read.Anything that weaken this causal relationship that is some other factor is responsible for the increase will be the valid contender for the answer.C states that increase is due to the purchasing power of the people.Hence undermines the conclusion.

The argument makes an assumption that the increased demand in manuscript copies caused the number of people who learned how to read to increase. Seems like a pretty bold claim.

Let's say people(100) used to travel by railroads/trains and now that airplanes are there to take people from one place to another, the conclusion says that now more people now are travelling. A possible weakener would be that airlines started discounting tickets as against railroads and thus people(100 again) could afford more travelling.

Stating this ensures that the conclusion is true. It eliminates any doubts (other possibilities such as drinking more than 25 cans a day).

Answer CThis is the way that I look at the problem.Bevex causes cancer for humans only if they drink over 25 cans per day.  Thus it is safe for people.  Why is it safe for humans?  Because humans wont drink 25 cans in a day. People drink fewer than 25 cans of Bevex-sweetenedsodaper day.C is the best answer but it seems to be little out of scope coz it talks of Soda and not Soft drinks, now experts will say its more of a common sense.""a person would have to drink 25 cans of Bevex-sweetenedsoft drinksper day""Are they not two different things eleganBevex, an artificial sweetener used only in soft drinks, is carcinogenic for mice, but only when it is consumed in very large quantities.

Conclusion: Bevex is in fact safe for people.To conclude that Bevex is safe for human consumption we have to assume that a person doesn’t consume more 25 cans or more than 25 cans of Bevex. This information is something that the authir has taken for granted. If we try the opposite of the answer “he does consume more than 25 cans” the argument falls apart. Hence, the correct answer is B. Hi Expert,How come ""A"" is not the weakener?In my reckoning, nowhere in the argument it is mentioned that the rate at which Bevex becomes carcinogenic for Humans is similar to mice.However, it does give an info stating that to only after having more than 25 cans a day it becomes carcinogenic for humans.But the rate at which it becomes carcinogenic for humans is no where mentioned.What if, humans have a better immune system than mice and can ward off more than 30 cans equivalent of Bevex.Am I on the right track thinking this?Thanks for your reply. honneeeyHi Expert,How come ""A"" is not the weakener?In my reckoning, nowhere in the argument it is mentioned that the rate at which Bevex becomes carcinogenic for Humans is similar to mice.However, it does give an info stating that to only after having more than 25 cans a day it becomes carcinogenic for humans.But the rate at which it becomes carcinogenic for humans is no where mentioned.What if, humans have a better immune system than mice and can ward off more than 30 cans equivalent of Bevex.Am I on the right track thinking this?Thanks for your reply.The argument concludes that Bevex is safe for people. Here's how the author gets there:Bevex is carcinogenic for mice when consumed in very large quantities.The very large quantity of Bevex observed to be carcinogenic for mice is equivalent to 25 cans of Bevex-sweetened drinks per day for a person.Therefore, Bevex is safe for people.(C) is the best answer choice because it confirms that people drink fewer Bevex-sweetened drinks than the quantity observed to be carcinogenic (25 cans per day). This connects the logical dots leading to the conclusion. Now, let's take a closer look at why we eliminate choice (A).Quote:(A) Cancer from carcinogenic substances develops more slowly in mice than it does in people.A carcinogenic substance is not the same thing as cancer. Carcinogenic substances have the potential tocausecancer, which can then develop at a slow or rapid rate within the afflicted body. The argument states that Bevex is safe for people, specifically because Bevex isnotcarcinogenic when consumed below a certain quantity per day (25 cans per day). This argument is about a substance thatmaycause cancer, but it is not about the cancer itself.(A) tells us that once cancer has begun to develop as a result of carcinogenic substances, it does so more slowly in mice than it does in people. But a substance that causes cancer can be considered carcinogenic regardless of whether the resulting cancer develops slowly or quickly.(A) does not tell us how people are impacted by Bevex in particular. Also, it tells us nothing about how people consume Bevex (i.e. quantity consumed per day). As a result, this choice does nothing to connect the dots of the argument.We eliminate the choice because it really doesn't address the specific argument being made.I hope this helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Bevex, an artificial sweetener used only in soft drinks, is carcinogenic for mice, but only when it is consumed in very large quantities.

I will start by saying that I do not typically employ a negation strategy because of the very consideration you bring up here. (Many people use negation onassumptionquestions only.) I prefer to engage directly with the answer choices, as written, rather than alter anything and hope I have done so in line with the question. However, in the interest of answering your questions, I would negate choice (B) in the second manner you have outlined. Think about that first one for a minute: how couldNOfood additives be tested but yield results that showed thatsomeof those non-additives were carcinogenic for mice? That would be some experiment, the laboratory equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes, I guess. (You can look up that reference if you are unfamiliar with that children's tale.) Even with the proper negation, though, we are left with an overreachingall food additives. The passage does not concern itself withallfood additives, but with Bevex only, and the conclusion is that Bevex issafe forpeople.

Besides, the point of the passage is that consumers are unable to know these effects.(B) Yes.The point of the passage is that consumers cannot know which products truly harm the environment and so are unable to choose to restrict their purchases to environmentally benign products.(C) No. The passage concerns the morality of the choices consumers make, not the options offered to consumers.(D) No. There is no discussion of the gradation of harm in the passage.

Can you help me paraphrase and simplify the whole argument.I am lost while tracking the main conclusion and the main premise.Ah, a question about moral principles... sounds like the LSAT to me!Start with conclusion, which is that ""there can be no moral duty to choose products in the way these environmentalists urge."" In other words, there can be no moral duty to avoid products that directly or indirectly harm the environment. Why not?It is usually impossible for consumers to assess the environmental impact of a product.If consumers can't assess the environmental impact of a product, then they can't know whether that product directly or indirectly harms the environment.If consumers don't know whether products directly or indirectly harm the environment, then consumers cannot ""consciously restrict their purchases to environmentally benign products.""If every product had a label indicating whether the product harmed the environment, then, according to many environmentalists, consumers would have a moral duty to purchase only environmentally benign products. But if consumers cannot assess the environmental impact of a product, then then have no way to decide between harmful and benign products. Consumers can't have a moral duty to choice between harmful and benign products if those consumers cannot differentiate between harmful and benign products.See if that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Because of this impossibility there can be no moral duty to choose products in the way these environmentalists urge, since-> ""Since"" implies there should be a premise supporting the conclusion that there can be no moral duty to choose products in the way the environmentalists urge.SO we should find a reason supporting this.(A) a moral duty to perform an action is never based solely on the effects the action will have on other peopleIt does not affect the conclusion.(B) a person cannot possibly have a moral duty to do what he or she is unable to doYes.

Many thanks.Don't you think that you are making an assumption in E?

There can be other reasons as well in lieu of which people don't vote this party. Hi MarcabYou agree that there is thin chance that people will vote for the land party that lends 1% support to the conclusion. The option will be a strengthener even if it lends 1 % support. Moreover its direct that A is odd man out and has no effect on the conclusion. Hi MarcabI'd just compare these 2 sentencesThe economic woes of the years surrounding that election hit agricultural and small business interests the hardest, and the Land Party specifically targeted those groups in 1935The greater the degree of economic distress someone is in, the more likely that person is to voteThe first sentence is from the question, the second from E.  I think that E makes the main sentence much stronger for the Land Party.Cheers,James Quote:Assumption that if people come out to vote, after having their problems addressed, they will vote only the Land party.As long as the assumption is within reasonable parameters we must consider it, in order to determine whether there are certain scenarios (not out of the scope ) where this statement  could in fact strengthen the argument. It would not be unreasonable to accept as LEGITIMATE a scenario where the economically distressed voters go out in large numbers and vote for the party that has been targeting them and there woes specifically.The AC (A) deals with something that does not refer to the elections under discussion (election of 35). There is no reasonable scenario where this statement can have any effect on the logic in the statement - Simply put, this statement speaks nothing on the elections being discussed based on which the historian is drawing his conclusion.Hope it helps.._________________""When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful.” - Eric ThomasSignature Read More (A) In preceding elections the Land Party made noattempt to address the interests of economicallydistressedurban groups.In option A the statement is given for ""Urban groups"" and our stimuli talks about ""rural and semi rural areas"".

I think CR can get really tricky. :(Per the conclusion, there are two reasons for success of Land Party (or a combo):- Land Party addressing the concerns of the groups-Depth of the economic problemsOption E talks about the Depth of the economic problems. It says the greater the degree of the problem for a person is, the more likely that person is going to vote.Why? Because that's what the argument says. adesai88(A) In preceding elections the Land Party made noattempt to address the interests of economicallydistressedurban groups.In option A the statement is given for ""Urban groups"" and our stimuli talks about ""rural and semi rural areas"". This is also one of the reason why answer option (A) is not strengthening the conclusion.This is a good observation. If this is the only reason to choose this option, I agree. However, I do not understand how others in this thread are stating that option A is irrelevant to the argument.Option A saysthat in preceding elections, Land party has made no attempt to address concerns.The argument saysLand party achieved itsONLYnational victory  in 1935.Wouldn't A strengthen the argument? I think it does because of the word ONLY.If I try to think of a reason for it to not strengthen, this is what i'm coming up with:Preceding elections - we do not know which year is being talked about. If it is before 1935, then it would weaken the argument. However, if it is after 1935, it would strengthen the argument. This could be one reason I would select this option.Can someone please correct/explain? This argument assumes a lot of things and the conclusion “the success of the Land Party that year was due to the combination of the Land Party’s specifically addressing the concerns of these groups and the depth of the economic problems people in these groups were facing” is based on those assumptions.We have to assume that the success was absolutely dependent only on the two factors mentioned in the passage and no other factor was involved in making that conclusion.All the options, apart from A, which is apparently our answer, hinges upon the fact that these were the only two factors responsible for the success.Option A starts with “In preceding election” which makes me suspicious about this option in terms of relevance. We do not really know if the interests of economically distressed urban groups were really a problem. Historian:The Land Party achieved its only national victoryin Banestria in 1935.

Answer choice (C), on the other hand, gives us information about ""most of [the Land Party's] successes,"" which could include local or regional victories.(C) states that most of these victories occurred during times of distress in the agricultural sector. This pattern strengthens the author's conclusion that the Land Party's national success in 1935 was, in part, due to ""the depth of the economic problems people in these groups were facing.""

Does the author want you to walk away with the knowledge that all businesses strive to improve productivity? No... this is simply information on which the rest of the argument is based:Every business strives to improve productivity.Often, attempts to increase productivity decrease the number of employees, which clearly harms the dismissed employees as well as the sense of security of the retained employees.In conclusion, ""not all efforts to increase productivity are beneficial to the business as a whole.""This is exactly whatGMATNinjais talking about in the ""How structural thinking can help"" section of theUltimate CR Guide for Beginners.Similarly, choice (E) is anaccuratestatement, but it doesn't represent the main conclusion. Rather, it is evidence in support of the main conclusion. Yes, to your point, there is a subtle difference between choice (E) and the statement in the passage, but even if choice (E) were worded exactly the same as the information in the passage, it would still not represent the author's main conclusion.In general, don't get lost in the trees and lose sight of the forest! Sometimes we can focus so much on little technical details that we lose track of the author's main point and the importance of the author's word choices.

I suspect that option A was an even greater temptation than E. Answer A is accurate. Neither option paraphrases the main argument.Re ""relevant part"": are you sure?In LR and CR, the conclusion does not have to be the last sentence in the paragraph. The conclusion is what the author istrying to prove.Trythis teston each sentence in the prompt:Is this statement what the author is trying to prove?Another test: the statement whose strength depends on the other statements is the conclusion.We have statements W, X, and Y. Because they are derived from premises, conclusions are distinctively supported by other statementsin the prompt. The conclusion is X or Y.If Xis supported byY, then X is the conclusion.If XsupportsY, then Y is the conclusion.You asked whether your analysis for rejecting E were convincing enough. Please don't read the spoiler unless you know the answerShow SpoilerNo. Because you have the wrong conclusion, although the distinction is clever, it is not the reason to reject E.Having read YOUR spoiler (with which I agree), I think you might have been predisposed towards a focus on employees.I can see how anyone would think that E or A were the answer.

This is a high quality question, and very tricky.Let's focus on the exact conclusion.  ""Because of the obvious bias of this report, it is clear that Ocksenfrey’s prepackaged meals really are nutritious.""The consumer establishes that there would likely be some bias, but from there, makes the extraordinary leap that what the biased parties were saying is wrong, viz. Ocksenfrey’s meals are nutritious.  That's a huge leap.Let's look at(D):(D)[argument]fails to provide evidence that Danto Foods’ prepackaged meals are not more nutritious than Ocksenfrey’s areTechnically, Danto Food's meals aren't discussed at all.  Yes, of course, the folks at Danto Foods would also like to claim that their own meals are nutritious, but technically, the question here analyzes only whether Ocksenfrey’s meals are nutritious, and no explicit comparison to Danto Foods’ meals is made.  That's why(D)is not correct.Let's look at(E):(E)[argument]presumes, without providing justification, that Danto Foods’ public relations department would not approve a draft of a report that was hostile to Danto Foods’ productsSuppose it were absolutely and objectively true that Ocksenfrey’s meals contain no nutritional value.  Well, then, the Connorly Report would be 100% accurate on its own, and Danto Foods’ public relations department would have absolutely no complaint with it.  In other words, in order for this fact to be something that comes into play,we need to assume that the conclusion is true.  If it really were the case that Ocksenfrey’s meals are highly nutritious, then conceivable that would be threatening to the folks at Danto Food's, and that PR department would block or alter the report.  Yes, that would be important,IFOcksenfrey’s meals really are nutritious, but if Ocksenfrey’s meals are not nutritious, then the Danto Food's PR department is irrelevant.  That's why(E)is incorrect.Choice(A)addresses the big leap made in the concluding line, the leap from the possible existence of bias to a sweeping judgment that the conclusion is wrong.  That is too much.  Sometimes biased people and biased corporate bodies happen to say things that are true.  Obviously biased and obviously wrong don't necessarily go together.Does all this make sense?Mike_________________Mike McGarryMagoosh Test PrepEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)Signature Read More creativemindduConsumer: The latest Connorly Report suggests that Ocksenfrey prepackaged meals are virtually devoid of nutritional value.

So what can we say? That the report's conclusions are biased so not to be trusted. It means we should ignore the report's conclusions. But can we establish the reverse from this? Can we establish that the meals are actually nutritious? No. We can say that the report should be ignored but not that it must be false and the reverse must be true.(A) treats evidence that there is an apparent bias as evidence that the Connorly Report’s claims are falseCorrect. The argument gives evidence of bias, not of establishing the report's claims as false. Saying that O's meals are actually nutritious is claiming the report's claim is false. This is a failure of the argument.(B) draws a conclusion based solely on an unrepresentative sample of Ocksenfrey’s productsNo information on sampled products.(C) fails to take into account the possibility that Ocksenfrey has just as much motivation to create negative publicity for Danto as Danto has to create negative publicity for OcksenfreyIrrelevant.

What D foods public relations dep would do if faced with a report hostile to its products is not known and is irrelevant. Whether they played a role in case of O food products is also not known.

But the drafts of the report are approved by a competitor - Coco Cola . the consumerwill always be biased with the results of reports since he is aware of underlined portion.But the jump from saying that reports are not trustworthy since they are approved by a competitor is bit valid than saying Pepsi's products are nutritious.

So what can we say? That the report's conclusions are biased so not to be trusted. It means we should ignore the report's conclusions. But can we establish the reverse from this? Can we establish that the meals are actually nutritious? No. We can say that the report should be ignored but not that it must be false and the reverse must be true.(A) treats evidence that there is an apparent bias as evidence that the Connorly Report’s claims are falseCorrect. The argument gives evidence of bias, not of establishing the report's claims as false. Saying that O's meals are actually nutritious is claiming the report's claim is false. This is a failure of the argument.(B) draws a conclusion based solely on an unrepresentative sample of Ocksenfrey’s productsNo information on sampled products.(C) fails to take into account the possibility that Ocksenfrey has just as much motivation to create negative publicity for Danto as Danto has to create negative publicity for OcksenfreyIrrelevant.

Comparative nutrition of the two is not the subject of discussion.(E) presumes, without providing justification, that Danto Foods’ public relations department would not approve a draft of a report that was hostile to Danto Foods’ productsThe argument presumes nothing about D foods products. What D foods public relations dep would do if faced with a report hostile to its products is not known and is irrelevant. Whether they played a role in case of O food products is also not known. All we know is that there is a bias, a conflict of interest in this case since O and D are rivals and hence the report may be biased.Answer (A)Hi,Could option E be correct if it were 'presumes, without providing justification, that Danto Foods’ public relations department would not approve a draft of a report that was submitted by Ocksenfrey'.I was inclined towards this option because it has the word 'presumes' and that is what the argument is doing.

It says that solar radiation, over the past century, was slightly greater in some years than in others . First of all, we don't know whether the ""slight"" variation in radiation is unique to this century; it could be true of previous centuries as well, seeing that the stimulus never explicitly rules out the possibility. Even assuming that the change in radiation levels is unique to this century, it's not inconsistent with the argument because it's claiming that the rise in temperature is PRIMARILY- not exclusively- due to the minor buildup of gases. B, on the other hand, very clearly says that most of the rise in temperature happened before the gas buildup, demonstrating that the accumulation of gases isn't mainly responsible for the temperature increase.

The argument's conclusion only follows logically if we make the assumption stated in choice (B): ""Only candidates eligible for appointment to the executive board can be accepted for the position of Executive Administrator.""If this statement were not true, the two conditions necessary for appointment to the executive board might not necessarily be required for the position of Executive Administrator.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More HiGMATNinjaExpertsPlease help me by validating my reasoning:Conclusion:Murray, an accountant with both a bachelor's and a master's degree, cannot be accepted for the position of Executive AdministratorPremise: he has a felony conviction and no one with a felony conviction can be appointed to the boardI am supposed to find correct assumption for this Q typeA and C -> Goes against the premise, rejectedE - > irrelevantI am confused between B and D.D -> If Murray did not have a felony conviction, he would be accepted for the position of Executive Administrator.

This option utilizes this fact against test taker(as i see it) who fell for the trap. In the LSAT/GMAT world, this problem can be countered by evaluating the necessary vs sufficient test. So, is it necessary that undergrad degree is a must for someone with a masters degree? No!

So how could we say that E-cars will have WORSE impact on environment? How could it be A.Rather, E stays neutral. Seems E must be the suitable one..And as for the term ""environmental degradation"" in option E. Check the premise, which has ""will result in an abatement of the environmental degradation"". So my take is E.Experts, please help...The answer is A. Answer E messes with the wording to try to trap you into the answer. The environmentalists are saying that electric cars eliminate environmental impact. It is definitely still possible to have them not be as great as the environmentalists think, but still be greater than the current system.Answer A is right for that very reason. It will have worse consequences than the proponents believe, because the proponents believe it will have ZERO consequences. That's why A is right.This may sound a little fuzzy, but I'll give you the advice that helped me on the LSAT (which I think offers much tougher CR questions than the GMAT). When I was doing the LSAT, I kept missing stupid CR questions until I realized one very important fact. There are no varying degrees of how ""good"" an answer is on the CR portion. One answer is RIGHT and the other four are WRONG. If you go through the 5 choices and think that two or more ""could"" be right, then something is wrong. It means that you are missing a key nuance somewhere. Either in the prompt, the question, or the answer choice. When that happens, I usually start by rereading the choices I'm debating between. After that I reread the question, then I reread the prompt (assuming that you haven't spotted the issue along the way). I give that order because I've found that for me personally, it breaks down like this. When I'm in that situation, about 60% of the time my error was in missing a nuance in the choices i'm debating between. About 30% of the time the error is in reading the other choices. And then about 10% of the time it's from the question or the prompt.Whenever I've tutored people I've told them that this is the single most valuable piece of information I ever figured out. It allowed me to go from consistently making stupid errors, to literally never missing a single CR question. It'll take some time to figure it out, but I encourage you to try it. When you do figure it out you'll feel a million times more confident on CR questions. Economist, my only issue with E is that the text doesn’t warrant a statement about the net affect.  The proponents of those cars believe that the environmental degradation will be abated that’s caused just by emission.  It doesn’t mention anything else which IMO is necessary for a net affect statement.  The text does absolutely support A though because it points out things that the proponents have not explicitly weighed._________________He that is in me > he that is in the world.  - source 1 John 4:4Signature Read More i go with A...The author with all his reasoning says that switching to electric cars won’t necessarily reduce environmental damage.(A) will have worse environmental consequences than its proponents may believe-Seems to be better option- hold.(B) will probably remain less popular than other types of cars-Info can be true sometime but not always true,(C) requires that purely technical problems be solved before it can succeed-uses similar terminology as in the passage but presents irrelevant information(D) will increase the total level of emissions rather than reduce it-Too extreme or out of scope.(E) will not produce a net reduction in environmental degradation-the author never compares levels of environmental damage.

Choice (C) can, indeed, be inferred from the proponents' claim in the first sentence. The author does not dispute this claim. Instead, the author assumes that the claim is true and then builds an argument on that hypothetical situation. So while choice (C) is a valid inference made in the argument, it is not the logical conclusion of the argument.Quote:(D) will increase the total level of emissions rather than reduce itWe are only told that ""each of these three power sources produces considerable environmental damage."" We are not told HOW exactly they cause environmental damage. Perhaps those power sources produce environmental degradation in other ways besides emissions. Choice (D) cannot be logical inferred without further information.Quote:(E) will not produce a net reduction in environmental degradationThe author suggests that, even though automobile emissions will be reduced, powering electric cars will lead to an increase in environmental degradation from the three power sources mentioned. But the author does NOT necessarily contend that the environmental degradation from the power sources will outweigh the ""abatement of the environmental degradation caused by auto emissions.""In other words, the author suggests that the ""abatement of the environmental degradation caused by auto emissions"" will be offset by an increase in environmental degradation caused by powering the electric cars. However, the author does not indicate thedegreeto which that abatement will be offset. The author's argument is valid whether electric cars produce a net reduction or a net increase in environmental degradation, so (E) can be eliminated._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Dear experts,@GMATNinja;GMATNinjaTwoI still find A not persuasive as the correct answer (even though I was able to eliminate all other choices).

The author sites situations that will degrade the environment more than the car emissions would. We must not forget here that he sites the 3 situations just to REFUTE the proponents' stand. The author is not concerned about the direct impact of the cars on environment, but is worried about the wrong thinking of the proponents.(A) will have worse environmental consequences than its proponents may believe -Correct as per our thinking above.(B) will probably remain less popular than other types of cars -We can't say this from the passage above. The passage is about the environment degradation and not the popularity of cars.(C) requires that purely technical problems be solved before it can succeed -Irrelevant.(D) will increase the total level of emissions rather than reduce it -Emissions will be decreased. This is opposite of what is given in the passage.(E) will not produce a net reduction in environmental degradation -We don't know the net effect. Maybe damming of rivers will be done on a smaller scale than before. We just don't have sufficient information about this option.

The argument suggests that the production of electric cars is not without consequences, specifically those which pose a threat to the environment. These ""hidden"" ramifications weaken the proponents' conclusion that environmental degradation will be mitigated by switching to electric cars.B: Irrelevant. We are not concerned with the popularity of electric cars.C: Fails to address the crux of the argument - that electric cars are not without environmental risks.D: While this could be possible, the argument neither makes this distinction, nor does it provide evidence to suggest that this may be the case.E: Like D, we have no way of knowing whether the total level of emissions will rise or fall as a result of increased electric car production, because this comparison is never made. All we know is that electric cars do pose a threat to the environment, albeit indirectly. I think option A is the correct choice. To understand the choice, focus on the tone and structure of the passage. First author presents what proponents of the passage think and according to them using electric cars will result in abatement of environmental degradation. Then author presents his own reasoning. Why the author is mentioning that other three sources - hydroelectric, nuclear , and coal have considerable negative impact. To let us reader knows that even with these three sources, negative impact won't be net zero. it will have some considerable negative impact. Option E is more on neutral tone but author does not seem to be neutral on the issue. Author's tone is pessimistic and not neutral. The words ""each of three sources have considerable negative impact"" suggest that author believes the electric car will have more negative impact even though more dams are built to produce electricity. This CR question requires both critical thinking and skill to understand the tone of the author",https://gmatclub.com/forum/proponents-of-the-electric-car-maintain-that-when-163401.html

OR some other reasons, which shows that though in the past people in the age group 13 to 16 used to purchase more, now the trend is changing.Keeping these ideas in mind, let us look at the options.Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument?A. Most people 17 years old or older have never purchased a video game.[This kind of strengthens the argument, instead of weakening it - Eliminated.]B. Video game rentals have declined over the past 3 years.[Out of Scope: Rentals are not in question here.]C.

This does not help us in deciding if the sale would increase or decrease! - Eliminated]E. Most of the people who have purchased video games over the past 3 years are over the age of 16[Now this gives us a reason that can weaken the argument. If people over the age of 16 have been buying games, then that means even if age group of 13 to 16 declines, the sale won't go down, instead it might even go up! Thus, this is the correct answer.] A is irrelevant because of two reasons:1) The segment that the argument and hence the answer focuses on is 13-16 years old.2) Statement A does not tell the prospects i.e. whether this group will buy or not.Option E is the best choice. adkikaniAlthough video game sales have increased steadily over the past 3 years, we can expect a reversal of this trend in the very near future.

I think you said it perfectly here: ""E -- It means that historical trends are changing and data from last 3 years follows a different trend. --> More and more people over the age of 16 are buying video games"".We are told that video game sales have increased steadily over the past 3 years. Choice (E) suggests that much of that increase came from people over the age of 16. In that case, the INCREASE in sales to people over 16 might make up for the potential decrease in sales to people from 13 to 16 years of age._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More I interpreted option E as the people who purchased video games were under the age of 16 at the time of purchase.

Can anybody elaborate on this.Thank you.This is a common misconception I see while tutoring people in CR. The answer choices never really dispute the information given in the passage. If they seem too, you're probably not parsing the claims in the argument carefully enough. The answer choices won't be wrong simply by directly contradicting the argument. Choice E should have been worded more clearly, but it's saying that those 13-16 year olds who purchased so many games have now aged, and perhaps they will still be the avid video game purchasers. It doesn't contradict be argument because a few years ago they were in this age group purchasing all of the video games.Here is an example of a problem where people often mistakenly think that an answer choice contradicts the stem:Fast-food restaurants make up 45 percent of all restaurants in Cantaria. Customers at these restaurants tend to be young; in fact, studies have shown that the older people get, the less likely they are to eat in fast-food restaurants. Since the average age of the Canatrian population is gradually rising and will continue to do so, the number of fast-food restaurants is likely to decrease.Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) Fast-food restaurants in Canatria are getting bigger, so each one can serve more customers.(B) Some older people eat at fast-food restaurants more frequently than the average young person.((some people take this to be a contradiction of the fact in the argument that younger people eat more fast food in general. It didn't say that. It was just an average. This is a wrong answer choice but it's not because it contradicts anything in the argument))(C) Many people who rarely eat in fast-food restaurants nevertheless eat regularly in restaurants.(D) The overall population of Canatria is growing steadily.(E) As the population of Canatria gets older, more people are eating at home. arpitkaushik96I eliminated (e) because according to me it goes against/refutes the facts given in the argument and this is not allowed in CR.

But several centuries ago the complaint was that certain intellectual skills, such as the powerful memory and extemporaneous eloquence that were intrinsic to oral culture, were being destroyed by the spread of literacy. So, what awaits us is probably a mere alteration of the human mind rather than its devolution.The author says, that its a common complaint that XYZ is corroding a particular skill that was fostered by EMB. Then he takes the argument back to several centuries ago, and says that there was another complain at that time, that ABC was corroding intellectual skills that were developed and perhaps necessary for oral culture...He then goes on to conclude that, the complainants are probably over reacting and what we are seeing is not the elimination of a particular skill set/ capability but a mere adaptation, that is not uncommon with progress.The conclusion here is very important to find the correct answer choice: What role can the second point (historic reference) play that more logically shores up the conclusion? Choice (C) claims that what happened in the past was not necessarily detrimental in the overall scheme of things. This is exactly what the author wants to show...like in the past, the current change is not necessarily detrimental but rather evolutionary.  If C is assumed to be the purpose of the second claim (historic) then the conclusion makes perfect sense.Whats wrong with B?B states that :an illustration of the general hypothesis beingadvanced that intellectual abilities areinseparable from the means by which peoplecommunicateThe second reference, is clearly a SPECIFIC reference to a particular change in society, that had an effect on the status quo. The historical change being reffered to is a specific one, that shows the reaction at that time to certain changes in society. It is far from being a GENERALIZATION or a general hypothesis. Based on this alone choice (B) can be eliminated.D States thatevidence that the claim that the intellectual skills required and fostered by the literary media are being lost is unwarrantedThe Historical reference does not by itself 100% guarantee that opinion of the current generation, is WRONG. It merely points to the fact that similar changes have happened in the past, and opinions held by people of those times were not entirely correct. It does not go as far as to claim that because folks were wrong then, the people must be wrong in the present. The connection is not STRONG as the choice (D) implies, but is rather subtle, in that the author is trying to show to the reader, that people do have a tendency to confuse evolutionary change with a devolution or a loss of a particular capability....The conclusion begins with"" SO WHAT AWAITS US IS PROBABLY.....""This suggests that the author is using the historical information, and trying to assess whether the current beliefs are illfounded are not. By adding PROBABLY he is showing clearly that what he is concluding is an opinion, or a hypothesis, and that he has used the historical reference as a general guide, to predict....and not to totally rubbish the opinion held by the people...Hope it helps!_________________""When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful.” - Eric ThomasSignature Read More The stimulus says that there are complains that electronic media is detrimental to intellectual skills.

C mentions cultural change which actually cannot be implied. Its more of a generalisation than implication of whats mentioned in the text. Whereas D mentions claim is unwarranted.

By itself the historical reference does not really indicate anything about the validity of the currently held beliefs, therefore it is not used in this context for the sake of providing evidence, but more as an example that goes out and shows that there is a possibility that the current generation is not understanding the evolutionary change that is taking place...The author attempts to connect the historical misjudgement with that of the current generation, and as such argues that there is a possibility that the current generation is making the same error of judgement as done in the past, when another cultural change was being resisted._________________""When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful.” - Eric ThomasSignature Read More Agree with C. Although D seems tempting, it is not a correct answer.(D) evidence that the claim that the intellectual skills required and fostered by the literary media are being lost is unwarrantedthe argument does not provide evidence that the intellectual skills required and fostered by the literary media will not be lost. On the contrary, it provides an example, which as well was thought to be detrimental, but did not have the expected result.

Gunjan00123how can we eliminate option b and c?Quote:(B) an illustration of the general hypothesis being advanced that intellectual abilities are inseparable from the means by which people communicateThe author is NOT trying to conclude that ""intellectual abilities areinseparablefrom the means by which people communicate"". Maybe the author would agree with that to some extent, but it's not the point of this particular passage.The author's conclusion is that the shift towards electronic media will merelyalterthe human mind, rather than cause its devolution. The example from several centuries ago is provided in support of that conclusion:People are complaining that electronic media have corroded the intellectual skills required and fostered by theliterarymedia.But centuries ago, people complained about literacy itself, claiming that a shift towards literacy was corroding certain intellectual skills. Did the human mind and intellectual skills change? Sure. But the human mind didn't devolve, exactly.So, the same thing will probably happen now The human mind and intellectual skills will likely change, but that doesn't mean that the human mind will devolve. In other words, there will be change, but that change isn't necessarily negative.Will the mind and intellectual skills change when there's a cultural change? Probably. Are those changes necessarily negative or detrimental? No.The example from several centuries ago shows that you can have a cultural change that doesn't necessarily have a detrimental effect on the human mind overall -- and that's pretty much what choice (C) says, making it our best option.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More I was stuck between C and D. Below is one complete explanation by an MANHATTANPREP expert:This is a rather complex core structure:Opposing Point: People complain about electronic media killing literary skills.Premise: But people complained about literacy killing oral culture skills.Conclusion: Electronic media results are likely a change in the mind, not devolution of the mind.The statement we're after is clearly the premise here - but it serves as evidence for what exactly? Keep a close eye on the author's final conclusion. His point is that our brains are just going to change, rather than shrivel up and die. Who is he arguing with? People who think our brains are going to shrivel up and die.Who thinks that? Probably the same people who are complaining about electronic media. Why do they think our brains are going to shrivel up and die? Because they say electronic media is killing literary skills.So, we could think of those people having a core of their very own. It would look something like this:Complainers' Premise: Electronic media is killing literary skills.Complainers' Conclusion: Therefore, our brains are going to devolve!The author pats them on the head and tells them not to worry. Something similar to what they are worried about happened long long ago. (It's implied that our brains did not shrivel up and die back then). So, he concludes, they probably aren't going to shrivel up and die now.Note that the author never, ever disputes that electronic media might be killing our literary skills. His conclusion is entirely about whether our the human mind will devolve as a result. To support the claim that it won't, he points to a situation where a new skill (literacy) arguably killed off an old skill (oral culture skills), and yet our minds did not devolve. This is expressed in (C).The Vile Temptress (D)(D) is incredibly tempting. We know we have an opposing point, we know the author is using this statement as evidence to support his own point somehow - so this looks like water in the desert to us if we aren't careful.But make sure your language radar is set at high scan! This answer says the statement is evidence that the claim is unwarranted. The author never actually says anything is unwarranted. mrudula_2005 is correct that the author's conclusion is soft and weak, with a 'probably', instead of a bold 'that's unwarranted!' claim.However, that's not the only problem. The author's claim is that the unspoken opposing conclusion is probably incorrect. The author never says a thing about the idea that electronic media is killing our literary skills. That concept is really the premise of the opposing camp, and the author just disagrees with their conclusion (that our minds will devolve).Also Not the Function(A) The statement is evidence, for sure, but not for the claim that electronic media is killing literary skills. That's the opposition's complaint!(B) ""the means by which people communicate"" is a language shift; the argument is not at all about the concept of ""inseparability"", nor is the conclusion a general hypothesis (rather it is a qualified prediction).(E) This statement is not dismissed; it is also not evidence the opposition would draw on to support their argument (that our minds will devolve). option C and D are contenders but choice C is the correct answer IMO. Reason is last line of the author ""So, what awaits us is probably a mere alteration of the human mind rather than its devolution."" Author is not absolutely sure that in current times, intellectual skills required and fostered by the literary media are not being lost. He is merely saying probably this is not as bad as it looks. it might be just the alteration of human mind rather than its devolution. So option D talks about the evidence that the same claim is unwarranted. but as I said earlier, author is not denying the claim completely. so D can't be the answer. Option C captures the essence of the line. It is an example presented to show that don't be too pessimistic. It might be the case that what happening now with electronic media may not have detrimental impact.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/it-is-now-a-common-complaint-that-the-electronic-media-have-143098.html

Let's say there are 100 used cans (L = 100), all of which were recycled into M cans. However, only half of the aluminum in the M cans came from L: the other half must have come from somewhere else. Clearly, then, assuming that the cans don't vary in the amount of aluminum they contain, and don't contain any other materials, the M group must be twice as big as the L group (M = 200).One piece is missing for this argument to be bullet-proof: we need to assume that there is no loss of aluminum during recycling. If there was, and the 100 L cans provided 50% of the aluminum in M, then the M group would be less than twice the size of the L group. This prephrase agrees with answer choice (C). Although this is a Justify question, answer choice (C) is both sufficient, and necessary, for the conclusion to be logically valid. In other words, answer choice (C) would have been also correct if this were an Assumption question.Answer choice (A) is incorrect, because whether the aluminum in M can be further recycled or not has no bearing on the conclusion of the argument.Answer choice (B) is incorrect, because the quality of the aluminum used is entirely irrelevant to this argument.Answer choice (C) is the correct answer choice, as explained above.Answer choice (D) is incorrect, because the source of aluminum in L has no bearing on its ability to be recycled into M.Answer choice (E) is incorrect, because it is entirely outside the scope of the argument.

If we heat milk to the same temperature using a microwave, half of the enzyme is destroyed. This seems to imply that the microwaves destroy the enzyme, not the heat.However, choice (E) tells us that when we use a microwave to heat milk to 50° C, small zones where the temperature is much hotter than 50° C are created. The enzymes in those small zones might be destroyed by the high heat (temperatures much hotter than 50 degrees).

What if the depletion of lysozyme has nothing to do with microwaves? Maybe microwaves do something else to the milk that destroys its lysozyme?Answer choice (A) is incorrect, because it is consistent with the information in the stimulus. If heating the milk to 50'C destroys half of the lysozyme, it's possible that heating it to a boiling temperature would destroy all of it. There is no reason to believe that this would weaken the argument.Answer choice (B) is incorrect, because the issue is not whether the lost enzymes can be replaced, but rather why they are lost in the first place.Answer choice (C) is incorrect, because it only stands to reason that liquids heat up faster when exposed to higher temperatures. This does not explain the difference in the amount of lysozyme observed.Answer choice (D) is incorrect, because the issue of taste has no bearing on the conclusion of the argument. The question is why microwaved milk has less lysozyme than milk exposed to conventional heat source, not whether this difference affects taste.Answer choice (E) is the correct answer choice. If heating milk by microwave creates small zones within it that are much hotter than 50'C, then it stands to reason that these pockets will lose lysozyme at a higher rate than the rest of the milk.

At this point we can try to paraphrase  or move onto the answer choices..Lets keep the Premise and conclusion in mind so that we can attack the answer choices:(A)The number of individuals in the high-riskgroup for influenza will not significantlychange from year to year.If we add this assumption to the premise provided, do we get a logical conclusion? Even if the no. of people in the group do not change or change it will have no bearing on whether those people would need or not need the vaccine next year. WE CAN SAFELY move on ..(B)Quote:The likelihood that a serious influenza epidemicwill occur varies from year to year.The likelihood of the virus occurring has nothing to do with the repeated inoculation of a different type of vaccine (strain).. Even if the incidence of influenca epidemic drops significantly we have no indication from either the passage or the answer choice which suggests that the government will roll back its decision to vaccinate people. The argument still remains in the same LOGICAL position as it existed in the original passage (we are to strengthen this logical position of the argument through the introduction of an assumption)(C)Quote:No vaccine for the influenza virus protectsagainst more than one strain of that virusA Basic requirement in any assumption question is that the assumption must be an ADDITIONAL PREMISE. This is a craftily worded paraphrase of an all ready mentioned premise : "" Each year’s vaccination will protect only against the strain of the influenza virus"" , Therefore this FAILS the test ( P + A ---> Conclusion)(D)Quote:Each year the strain of influenza virus deemedmost likely to be prevalent will be one that hadnot previously been deemed most likely to beprevalent.This is the correct answer. The assumption fills one major HOLE in the argument (something which some may be able to paraphrase before reviewing the answer choices). If someone made this argument to me (passage). I could rebut by saying "" What if you have 2-3 consecutive years where every year a similar strain will be considered dangerous"" "" would your conclusion not be FALSE then?"" If you wanted to WIN the argument, you can rebut by saying ""Each year the strain of influenza virus deemed most likely to be prevalent will be one that had not previously been deemed most likely to be prevalent.""..And you will win the argumentThis meets the P + A --> Conclusion test as it makes the overall argument more logical.(E)Quote:Each year’s vaccine will have fewer side effectsthan the vaccine of the previous year since thetechnology for making vaccines will constantlyimprove.This answer choice is out of scope, as it goes on a different tangent altogether and is the easiest one to eliminate because of that !Hope this helpsOA : DThis question becomes so much easier, if we take a bit of time to write down the premise and conclusion on our scratch pads before we begin searching for the correct assumption ( this way we can easily realize that C is a rewording of a pre existing premise so that we can avoiding falling into the trap)..._________________""When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful.” - Eric ThomasSignature Read More I chose answer C - but to be honest, it was a tossup for me between C & D. Both seem correct to me.The conclusion is that the high-risk group will need to be vaccinated every year.Answer C seems like a necessary assumption - as if some vaccines protected against multiple strains of the virus, annual vaccination may not be necessary.Likewise, answer D seems like a necessary assumption - as if the same strain broke out year after year, the high risk group would already have been vaccinated against it, mitigating the need for repeat vaccination. plumber250Hi Grace,I think the Answer is likely to beD.  Whilst both C and D are assumptions, answer C has already been mentioned in the questionEach year’s vaccination will protectonlyagainst the strain of the influenza virus deemed most likely to be prevalent that yearHope that helps.Happy to run through the rest of the options if that helps.Cheers,JamesJames -Thanks! Your explanation was very helpful. I was missing that detail in the original paragraph that all vaccinations would only be protecting against a single strain. Should have gone back and read it again! Anyhow, many thanks for the help.All the best - D is better than C for 2 reasons.First, C is too extreme because of ""no vaccine""Secondly, because of ""vaccine for different strain"", D is the winner My answer : DThe conclusion says ""different strain"" -> this means a new strain becomes prevalant every new year.  Option C was appealing but no where it was mentioned that vaccines are aimed at one single stain. vomhorizonA new government policy has been developed to avoid many serious cases of influenza. This goal will be accomplished by the annual vaccination of high-risk individuals: everyone 65 and older as well as anyone with a chronic disease that might cause them to experience complications from the influenza virus. Each year’s vaccination will protect only against the strain of the influenza virus deemed most likely to be prevalent that year, so every year it will be necessary for all high-risk individuals to receive a vaccine for a different strain of the virus.Which one of the following is an assumption that would allow the conclusion above to be properly drawn?(A) The number of individuals in the high-risk group for influenza will not significantly change from year to year.(B) The likelihood that a serious influenza epidemic will occur varies from year to year.(C) No vaccine for the influenza virus protects against more than one strain of that virus.(D) Each year the strain of influenza virus deemed most likely to be prevalent will be one that had not previously been deemed most likely to be prevalent.(E) Each year’s vaccine will have fewer side effects than the vaccine of the previous year since the technology for making vaccines will constantly improve.Source: LSAThiI am feeling very good to get this CR rightlet me explain to you howFor any argument to hod true, assumptions must hold true. Here in the question, choice ""c"" states something that does not have to be true for the conclusion to hold true. Yes, taking vaccine for different strain of virus every year does not mean that no vaccine can cure more than one strain of that virusNow, say, virus ""P"" was prevalent in the year, 2016, so, for the conclusion to hold true it must be assumed that this ""P"" virus cannot be prevalent in the year 2017, or if the ""P"" virus is prevalent in the year 2017, it must be assumed that this ""P"" virus was not prevalent in the year 2016, so people have to take different vaccination each year ...So answer choice ""D"" stands outthankscheers through the kudos button, if this helps you The key trick part of this question seems to reside on C or D, so let's focus on that after we BOIL down the argument.High-risk individuals needs vaccination to protect against the DAMN flu.Every year's vaccination only protects against the most prevalent version of DAMN flu.=> High-risk individuals need vaccination every year.(C) No vaccine for the influenza virus protects against more than one strain of that virus.Negate: Some vaccines for DAMN flu protects against more than 1 strain. Ok, so potentally if a high-risk individual is LUCKY and got a flu shot last year that protects against this year..he doesn't need it anymore. But if he isn't lucky...well it doesn't end well for him. This partially destroys the argument.(D) Each year the strain of influenza virus deemed most likely to be prevalent will be one that had not previously been deemed most likely to be prevalent.This says....80% (most likely) chance, this year's flu will be different from last year's flu; 80% chance, next year's FLU will different from this year's flu.In other words..there's a higher chance that every year we will have a different flu....THUS why we need vaccination every year.(D) is relatively better than (C). But the tricky part is...when we negate (C), we all know it partially destroys the argument..and our mind wants THAT to be the answer. IT doesn't help that LSAT devils particularly used ""No vaccine"" - an extreme case or..LURE for negation.

However, each year’s vaccination will protect only against the strain of virus deemed most likely to be prevalent that year. On that basis, the author concludes that high-risk individuals will need to be immunized for a different strain every year.The conclusion contains a logical gap, and a suitable prephrase is in order: what if the most prevalent strain never changes? If so, then there'd be no reason to receive a different vaccine every year. To prove the conclusion, we must establish that each year's most prevalent strain is different from the strain deemed most prevalent the year before. This prephrase agrees with answer choice (D).Note, that despite the word ""assumption"" in the question stem, this is a Justify question, because the correct answer choice must allow the conclusion to be properly drawn. In other words, it must be sufficient to prove the conclusion.Answer choice (A) is incorrect, because this would only affect the number of administered vaccines each year, not whether people need to be immunized for different strains every year.Answer choice (B) is incorrect, because the likelihood of an epidemic has no bearing on the question of whether the vaccines need to be changed each year.Answer choice (C) is attractive, but incorrect. If no vaccine protects against more than one strain, does that prove that we need to change the strains each year? Not unless we also assume that the most prevalent strain changes! If the most prevalent strain remains the same, we can keep using the same vaccine year after year, even if that vaccine protects against only one strain.Answer choice (D) is the correct answer choice, as it agrees with our prephrase above.Answer choice (E) is incorrect, because the question of side effects is extraneous to the argument.""(https://forum.powerscore.com/lsat/viewtopic.php?t=8658) vomhorizonA new government policy has been developed to avoid many serious cases of influenza.

Since mercury that accumulates in a seabird???s feathers as the feathers grow is derived from fish eaten by the bird, these results indicate that mercury levels in saltwater fish are higher now than they were 100 years ago.The argument depends on assuming that(A) the proportion of a seabird???s diet consisting of fish was not as high, on average, in the 1880s as it is today(B) the amount of mercury in a saltwater fish depends on the amount of pollution in the ocean habitat of the fish(C) mercury derived from fish is essential for the normal growth of a seabird???s feathers(D) the stuffed seabirds whose feathers were tested for mercury were not fully grown(E) the process used to preserve birds in the 1880s did not substantially decrease the amount of mercury in the birds??? feathersI have a doubt why option A is not the answer and how does it weakens the argument and affects the main conclusion. how should we with such type of options.THANK YOU Hi,please explain why A is wrong. If the proportion of diet is sholuld be same then only it is possible that the fishes in the comparision may have same mercury. IF we consider E, it is saying preservation decreased the mercury level substantially but it is not clear that whether the preservation has decreased it from same level.(The level found in feathers recently).Please clear my confusionthanks Pre-thinking:Conclusion:Mercury levels in saltwater fish are higher now than they were 100 years ago.Premises on which it is based:i) Mercury that accumulates in a seabird’s feathers as the feathers grow is derived from fish eaten by the bird.ii) Feathers recently taken from seabirds stuffed and preserved in the 1880s have been found to contain only half as much mercury as feathers recently taken from living birds of the same species.Prima facie the argument seems to make sense. If mercury in the feathers derives from fish eaten, and recent feathers have more mercury, it is logical to suggest that fish now have more mercury. Therefore, in order to find an assumption, we are looking for one of the following:1) Rule out an alternate explanation.2) Rule out a correlation (a third variable that influences both time and mercury in feathers).Let us examine the answers:(A) the proportion of a seabird’s diet consisting of fish was not as high, on average, in the 1880s as it is todayThis is worth considering. If mercury comes from fish, and the seabirds are eating more fish today, it is possible that this has led to more mercury. However, this assumes that the other portion of the diet does not contain any mercury. For now, we can hold on to this option.(B) the amount of mercury in a saltwater fish depends on the amount of pollution in the ocean habitat of the fishThis does not address the mercury in the feathers at all. Irrelevant. Eliminate.(C) mercury derived from fish is essential for the normal growth of a seabird’s feathersThis does not address the difference in the mercury levels in the feathers at all. Eliminate.(D) the stuffed seabirds whose feathers were tested for mercury were not fully grownWe know nothing about levels of mercury in the feathers of juvenile and adult seabirds. Out of scope. Eliminate.(E) the process used to preserve birds in the 1880s did not substantially decrease the amount of mercury in the birds’ feathersCorrect answer. This clearly rules out an alternate explanation for the different levels of mercury.Since (E) is a much cleaner option, we can eliminate option (A).Hope this helps._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More PrihansHi,please explain why A is wrong. If the proportion of diet is sholuld be same then only it is possible that the fishes in the comparision may have same mercury. IF we consider E, it is saying preservation decreased the mercury level substantially but it is not clear that whether the preservation has decreased it from same level.(The level found in feathers recently).Please clear my confusionthanks­Why A is wrong.Option A is strengtener and not the assumptionDefinition of assumption : The minimum necessary condition required by conclusion. This means you don't have to go above the minimum requirement when it comes to assumption.In case of strengthener , you can go above the minimum requirement. So basically, assumption is the subset of strengtheners.Now coming to A. Why option A is strengthener ? Because it gives more than what is minimum required. for conclusion to hold true we need the minimum condition that proportion of seabird's diet in 1880s is same as it is today.option A says "" not as high"" which means it was lower in 1880s but do we really need it to be lower. (yes if it is lower, it strengthens the conclusion) but this is not necessary condition. It is not minimum requirement. Even if it is same proportion, it would be sufficient.Hope this helps!",https://gmatclub.com/forum/feathers-recently-taken-from-seabirds-stuffed-and-163405.html

X didn't want innovation. There was little innovation in sculptor and more in paintings. How? Something must be different. Some painters must have painted with support of X, to what they like i.e. innovation. C solves the paradox.Wow, post LSAT, I might think of writing some mystery novels myself During the nineteenth century, the French academy of art was a major financial sponsor of painting and sculpture in France; sponsorship by private individuals had decreased dramatically by this time. Because the academy discouraged innovation in the arts, there was little innovation in nineteenth century French sculpture. Yet nineteenth century French painting showed a remarkable degree of innovationWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the amount of innovation in French painting and the amount of innovation in French sculpture during the nineteenth century(A) In France in the nineteenth century, the French academy gave more of its financial support to painting than it did to sculpture. --More financial support doesn't mean that paintings will be more innovative because we know from the premise that french academy didn't support innovation.(B) The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average, than individual sculptors. --Same as A; greater support doesn't mean greater innovation.(C) Because stone was so much more expensive than paint and canvas, far more unsponsored paintings were produced than were unsponsored sculptures in France during the nineteenth century. --Correct. The gretaer numbner of unsupported paintings help explain the greater number of innovative paintings(D) Very few of the artists in France in the nineteenth century who produced sculptures also produced paintings. --Out of scope(E) Although the academy was the primary sponsor of sculpture and painting, the total amount of financial support that French sculptors and painters received from sponsors declined during the nineteenth century. --Again, like option A, this option merely states the greater amount of support. A really good question with some close contenders. We need to resolve the paradox and the paradox  over here is the fact that despite French academy of art discouraging innovation in arts how is it true that 19th century paintings had much more innovation than 19th century sculptures. An important catch over here is that the French academy of art is a major financial sponsor of both paintings and sculptures.Let me just focus on options A, B and C as D and E are easy to strike off. A and B might seem tempting but despite the fact that painters received more financial support this finding cannot account for the higher degree of innovation observed in painting as the French academy of art anyways discouraged innovation and the more funds received by painters was probably invested not in innovation but in exnovation.Option C on the other hand gives a good enough reason to explain the high degree of innovation in painting. As paint and canvas was inexpensive hence there were more unsponsored painting and unsponsored painting does not require the academy's funds hence the painters no longer need to heed to the academy's advice whereas sculptures on the other hand required expensive stones and hence there were fewer unsponsored sculptures and most of the sculptures were sponsored by the academy hence there was little innovation. The reason A and B can be eliminated is the fact that1)Academy discouraged innovation, and2)Academy was the major sponsor for painting and sculpture.If the academy sponsor painter/sculptor, it would want the painter/sculptor to produce according to its requirements. Requirements did not involve INNOVATION. Hence,  anyone getting sponsorship from the academy is not expected to innovate.This is where A and B fall off.C explains that more painters produced unsponsored paintings. Hence, they innovated. During the nineteenth century, the French academy of art was a major financial sponsor of painting and sculpture in France; sponsorship by private individuals had decreased dramatically by this time. Because the academy discouraged innovation in the arts, there was little innovation in nineteenth century French sculpture. Yet nineteenth century French painting showed a remarkable degree of innovationWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the amount of innovation in French painting and the amount of innovation in French sculpture during the nineteenth century?Analysis: resolve the paradoxAcademy --financial support--> sculptureAcademy --financial support--> paintingpainting innovation > sculpture : why?may be painters are more self motivated or may be painters have significantly less issue compare to sculptures in term of financial support(A) In France in the nineteenth century, the French academy gave more of its financial support to painting than it did to sculpture. --> more financial support doesn't guarantee more innovation: it says in the premise that remarkable/significant innovations, more finance can't do that. there should be some other better reason for this.(B) The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average, than individual sculptors. --> so sculptors should be greater than paintings, but it's not(C) Because stone was so much more expensive than paint and canvas, far more unsponsored paintings were produced than were unsponsored sculptures in France during the nineteenth century. -->correct: align w/ analysis: paintings > sculptures>> so more innovations in paintings(D) Very few of the artists in France in the nineteenth century who produced sculptures also produced paintings. --> common artists will not resolve the paradox(E) Although the academy was the primary sponsor of sculpture and painting, the total amount of financial support that French sculptors and painters received from sponsors declined during the nineteenth century. --> doesn't resolve the paradox: sponsors declined --> innovations should declined for both B.The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average than individual sculptors.I understand that C is correct.But I want to know whether B could mean the following.Let's say there are 100 sculptors and 100 painters. The academy supported more sculptors than painters, for eg. 80 sculptors out of a group of 100 sculptors. And in this case, the academy is somehow not encouraging innovation amongst this 80.Whereas out of a group of 100 painters if the academy supported only 10 ( and that too let's say by providing the maximum support. ) 90 are left unsupported. And because these painters are not related to the academy they can innovate.If B somehow represents the situation above then B can very explain the discrepancy. Please let me know where I am wrong.Thank youSonal sonalchhajed2019B.The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average than individual sculptors.I understand that C is correct.But I want to know whether B could mean the following.Let's say there are 100 sculptors and 100 painters.

Please let me know where I am wrong.Thank youSonalKeep in mind that we are looking for the answer that ""most helps to explain the difference between the amount of innovation"" in French painting and sculpture. Since (C) explicitly tells us thatfar more unsponsored paintingswere produced than unsponsored sculptures, this explains the difference. But what about (B)?Quote:(B) The French academy in the nineteenth century financially supported a greater number of sculptors than painters, but individual painters received more support, on average, than individual sculptors.Notice that (B) doesn't tell us anything about the total number ofunsponsored artistsversus the number ofunsponsored sculptors. Nor does it tell us how many artists or sculptors there were total.In your consideration of (B), you assumed an equal number of artists and sculptors to begin with (i.e. 100 of each). But that assumes that there were an equal number of artists and sculptors, and we definitely can't make that assumption. For instance, what if there were 100 sculptors and only 50 painters? If the academy supported 80 sculptors and 50 painters (i.e. more sculptors than painters), there would still be moreunsupported sculptorsthanunsupported painters, and so we'd expect more innovation in sculpture.Overall, (C) provides a rock-solid explanation for the difference in innovation, so it's correct. Answer choice (B), on the other hand, requires us to make anassumptionfor it to explain the difference. So, (B) is incorrect.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More During the nineteenth century, the French academy of art was a major financial sponsor of painting and sculpture in France; sponsorship by private individuals had decreased dramatically by this time.

Philosopher: An action is morally right if it would be reasonably expected to increase the aggregate well-being of the people affected by it. An action is morally wrong if and only if it would be reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate wellbeing of the people affected by it. Thus, actions that would be reasonably expected to leave unchanged the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them are also rightThe philosopher’s conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?Analysis: assumptionwell-being ^--> rightwell-being v --> wrongconclusion: well-being = --> right: it's means authors is trying to say which is not wrong is right(A) Only wrong actions would be reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them. --> too strong, also this assumption will not support the conclusion, because describe the wrong, we don't know any relation between about well-being = & right from this(B) No action is both right and wrong. --> too generic: we don't know any relation between the well-being = & right from this(C) Any action that is not morally wrong is morally right. -->correct: align w/ analysis: we can derive the relation between the well-being = & right from this(D) There are actions that would be reasonably expected to leave unchanged the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them. --> irrelevant(E) Only right actions have good consequences--> irrelevant Premise : Actions that improve overall well being of people are morally right. Actions that decrease the overall well being of ppl are wrong. Actions that maintain status quo are also right. What is the underlying assumption in drawing such a conclusion? Actions that do good are good. Actions that do bad are bad. And actions that neither do good nor bad are also good. Hence assumption is that actions are good if they don’t do bad.(A) Only wrong actions would be reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate well-being of the people affected by themLargely correct, but this is not the assumption of the argument. Right actions too can lead to the detriment of ppl, but these actions are right because on aggregate they lead to well being of ppl. Aggregate being the key word.B) No action is both right and wrong.This is no where implied or assumed in the passage. On the contrary, the premise clearly delineates between what is right and wrong.(C) Any action that is not morally wrong is morally right.Correct Answer. As pointed out earlier, since actions fall into only two categories, one – those that do bad for the overall well being of ppl and two – those that either do good or do no harm.(D) There are actions that would be reasonably expected to leave unchanged the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them.While this is an assumption of the premise, it is not an assumption of the reasoning in the argument. We have to find an assumption that logically implies the reasoning of the argument, which is that actions that do not harm others are good.(E) Only right actions have good consequencesOn the contrary, the argument mentions that actions with no net benefit consequences are considered good too. Hence, this can not be the right answer. I came across this question recently. Got it right in the first attempt.I thought of it as an Overlapping-Sets DS problem.One set is morally right. The other one is morally wrong. Further, it says that the intersection is 0 because unchanged wellbeing is also morally right.Now, all this will only stand only when we assume that the Null Set (phi) is zero. Otherwise, actions that are not morally wrong can very well be of some third kind.Hence, option C makes the most sense >> 'Any action that is not morally wrong is morally right.' Philosopher: An action is morally right if it would be reasonably expected to increase the aggregate well-being of the people affected by it. An action is morally wrong if and only if it would be reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate wellbeing of the people affected by it.

Remember, an assumption is an UNWRITTEN premise/statement that MUST BE TRUE for the argument to be sound. Otherwise, it falls apart. Let's look at the options.(A) Only wrong actions would be reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them.This is something that is already mentioned in the question stem. We cannot assume this.(B) No action is both right and wrong.We cannot assume this from the stem. It explicitly states the two different cases.(C) Any action that is not morally wrong is morally right.Bingo.(D) There are actions that would be reasonably expected to leave unchanged the aggregate well-being of the people affected by them.This one is tricky. But remember again, this is something that is already stated in the passage. So, we cannot assume it.(E) Only right actions have good consequenceswe cannot assume this.

Wow! I ended up choosing E, but after seeing vomhorizon words above is clearly very far away from the conclusion. E is out-of-escope, as it does not address the issue of land usage. Ethicist: On average, animals raised on grain must be  fed sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound  of meat. A pound of meat is more nutritious for  humans than a pound of grain, but sixteen pounds  of grain could feed many more people than could  a pound of meat.

If the cattle can be fed on sources other than farmland grain then meat will be readily available.(C)  If a grain diet is supplemented with protein derived from non-animal sources, it can have nutritional value equivalent to that of a diet containing meat.  --This strengthens the argument(D)  Although prime farmland near metropolitan areas is being lost rapidly to suburban development, we could reverse this trend by choosing to live in areas that are already urban.  --""Could"" is a hypothetical scenario.(E)  Nutritionists agree that a diet composed solely of grain products is not adequate for human health. --This option talks about grain products and not about meat. Option(B) definitely weakens the conclusion.But doesn't option (D) also weaken the conclusion to an extent?

Am I thinking along the right lines?@abjijay,D doesn't really weaken the conclusion. The conclusion tells us that it might become morally unacceptable to eat meat because farmland gets lost because of overusage. D, however, only provided us with the information that humans can mitigate reduction of farmland by suburban development. But if the human race mitigates this kind of farmland reduction, the other kind of reduction due to farmland overusage doesn't get precluded. Hence, the reduction will still go on and it will be likely that consuming meat will be morally unacceptable.Hope that help MasterscorpabhijayOption(B) definitely weakens the conclusion.But doesn't option (D) also weaken the conclusion to an extent?

The conclusion tells us that it might become morally unacceptable to eat meat because farmland gets lost because of overusage. D, however, only provided us with the information that humans can mitigate reduction of farmland by suburban development. But if the human race mitigates this kind of farmland reduction, the other kind of reduction due to farmland overusage doesn't get precluded. Hence, the reduction will still go on and it will be likely that consuming meat will be morally unacceptable.Hope that helpThanksMasterscorpfor the explanation! I'll add my two cents, just in case it helps to hear things phrased another way...Yes, if (D) is true, we might be able to slow the loss ofprime farmland near metropolitan areas. But this refers to a very specific subset of the total farmland. Even if we save someprime farmland near metropolitan areas,totalfarmland could still increase, decrease, or stay the same. Without more information, we don't know whether (D) will help mitigate the farmland issue.And we still have to contend with the fact that the population is rapidly expanding and the fact that sixteen pounds of grain could feed many more people than could a pound of meat.The only way that (D) weakens the conclusion is if the amount of farmland saved by living in urban areas is enough to INCREASE total farmland to levels that can sustain the increasing demand for food. Without more information, (D) must be eliminated. I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Can someone tell me why E is wrong?_________________Beautiful is the one who continues to try despite failure.Signature Read More DiyaDuttaCan someone tell me why E is wrong?""We must accept the fact that consumption of meat will soon be morally unacceptable"" - notice that the author does NOT say that people should eat ONLY grain!

"A consumer magazine surveyed people who had sought a psychologist’s help with a personal problem. Of those responding who had received treatment for 6 months or less, 20 percent claimed that treatment “made things a lot better.” Of those responding who had received longer treatment, 36 percent claimed that treatment “made things a lot better.” Therefore, psychological treatment lasting more than 6 months is more effective than shorter-term treatment.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) Of the respondents who had received treatment for longer than 6 months, 10 percent said that treatment made things worse.(B) Patients who had received treatment for longer than 6 months were more likely to respond to the survey than were those who had received treatment for a shorter time.(C) Patients who feel they are doing well in treatment tend to remain in treatment, while those who are doing poorly tend to quit earlier.(D) Patients who were dissatisfied with their treatment were more likely to feel a need to express their feelings about it and thus to return the survey.(E) Many psychologists encourage their patients to receive treatment for longer than 6 months.Source: LSATShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","This critical reasoning question focuses on a flawed use of statistics.  A higher percentage of people who received treatment for longer than 6 months felt a lot better than did those who received treatment for under 6 months.  The interesting thing about this question is that one pool leads directly into the other.  People must receive therapy for less than 6 months before converting into the other pool and receiving therapy for more than 6 months.Answer choice C points this out and weakens the argument effectively.  If people are more likely to stay in therapy longer if it is going well, then a higher percentage of those people in therapy for a longer time will respond positively than will those who receive therapy for shorter time periods.  Thus it is not necessarily the longer therapy that is more effective, but rather that for people who find therapy effective they stay with therapy longer.  This could be thought of as reverse causation of sorts.  Instead of long therapy causing more positive results, more positive results will result in longer therapy.I hope this helps!!! Answer choice B in this question is wrong because it does not specify anything about those who felt it helped being more or less likely to respond, but rather just focuses on those who have received therapy for a longer time period being more likely to respond.  Basically it is not focused on the correct differentiator.  If there were 100 people who received therapy for more than 6 months and 100 people who received therapy for less than 6 months, and 50 of the people who received therapy for more than 6 months replied, but only 30 of those who received therapy for under 6 months replied, this does not change the fact that a higher percentage of the respondents of the longer therapy were helped.[quote=""mba1382""]Hi Brandon,I was stuck between B & C.

Could you please point out the flaw in the option B? Will appreciate.  Thanks. Well yes, initially it seems that answer c is wrong; However,option c is right  as it directly affects the # of people surveyed ( who remained and who left) whereas the option b is more on doubt about the degree of likeliness to respond or surveyed but does not communicate whether they have actually participated in survey or not. But option C, if true, will surly affect the difference in # of respondents responded between the two groups. there is a similar question and the answer is B because there the answer C does not appear!this is actually a mix question of explanation and weaken; clearly, the answer not only gives an explanation, but also weakens the claim that the treatment lasting more than 6 months is more effective. So when i was doing this question I was confused between B, C, D. Quick Ans why i choose C :-B) Patients who had received treatment for longer than 6 months were more likely to respond to the survey than were those who had received treatment for a shorter time.Means, For folks who had received treatment for longer than 6 months, both Negative responders and positive responders (in the same proportion) will be more likely to repond to the survey. We got 36% positive feedback. Unless told specifically that negative responders (in this group i.e. folks who had received treatment for longer than 6 months) are more than positive responders, we could say that more months is good, as we got 36% positive result.(C) Patients who feel they are doing well in treatment tend to remain in treatment, while those who are doing poorly tend to quit earlier.So if both positive and negative people are equaly likely to repond to the survey, then we can say that greater positive feedback gives better satisfaction or result.Now assume a situation in which positive users are more likely to continue the treatment for more than 6 months, making proportion of positive users more. So clearly this could weaken the argument. AS this could be a case where only satisfied people are opting for more than 6 months period. So may be treatment will result same effect, but as positive feedback people are more in the group the survey will result in 36% positive feedback. So ans c is correct.(D) Patients who were dissatisfied with their treatment were more likely to feel a need to express their feelings about it and thus to return the survey.Same as this hold true for both the groups i.e. group 1 -- who had treatment for less than 6 months and group 2- who had treatment for more than 6 months. A consumer magazine surveyed people who had sought a psychologist’s help with a personal problem. Of those responding who had received treatment for 6 months or less, 20 percent claimed that treatment “made things a lot better.” Of those responding who had received longer treatment, 36 percent claimed that treatment “made things a lot better.” Therefore, psychological treatment lasting more than 6 months is more effective than shorter-term treatment.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?Analysis: Weakenduration --> made things bettercase-1: less than 6 M --> 20%case-2: more than 6 M --> 36%Cause ---> effectConclusion: more than 6M treatment --> more effectiveA1: If ""made things worse"" % is more for case-2 than case-1, the conclusion will be weakenA2: if cause and effect relation reversed(more effective that's why more time) then the conclusion will be weaken(A) Of the respondents who had received treatment for longer than 6 months, 10 percent said that treatment made things worse. --> we don't know how much from case-1 says ""made tings worse""(B) Patients who had received treatment for longer than 6 months were more likely to respond to the survey than were those who had received treatment for a shorter time. --> we are talking about the % of effectiveness, so the more/less patents will not weaken the argument(C) Patients who feel they are doing well in treatment tend to remain in treatment, while those who are doing poorly tend to quit earlier. -->correct: reverse the cause-effect relationship: align w/ analysis-A2(D) Patients who were dissatisfied with their treatment were more likely to feel a need to express their feelings about it and thus to return the survey. --> same as B(E) Many psychologists encourage their patients to receive treatment for longer than 6 months. --> irrelevant: cant weaken the argument Something that struck my mind...How come those LSAT CR questions are often easier than the GMAT CR questions?

Depends upon which assumption one identifies here. Let me share my perspective.For those who identified only a sampling assumption or a comparison assumption, then choice B may have looked tempting.For those who identified only a causation assumption (or maybe all of the 3), this question gets slightly easier. This means one needs to get adept at finding as many assumptions during their practise sessions as possible.So one takeaway is not to generalize as you may already have well-developed reasoning.Hope you see the point.

Conclusion: Nations haveNO moral rightsorresponsibilities.Premise 2: Nations cannot survive unless many of its citizens attribute moral rights or responsibilities to themNations survive→Attribute rights/responsibilitiesThe conclusion indicator ""obviously"" in the last sentence shows this to be aMain Pointquestion. If nations cannot survive unless we attribute moral rights to them, but nations actually don't have such rights, it logically follows that a nation cannot survive unlesswe hold beliefs that are literally false. The combination of the sub. conclusion and the second premise proves answer choice(B)to be correct.Whether nations can be a target of moral praise or blame (C) is not a relevant consideration, and falls entirely outside the scope of the argument. The author's purpose is to illustrate some of the factors necessary for the survival of nations, not whether nations can be blamed or praised for something.(E) is incorrect, because the author never suggested that nations do not exist (literally). They do. It is the qualities we attribute to nations - not the nations themselves - that should be thought of in metaphorical rather than literal terms.Remember that the word “some” just means “one or more.” So all we need is one example of a false belief that needs to be held by citizens in order for nations to survive. And we have it… if citizens don’t believe the falsehood that their nations have moral rights, then nations will fail to survive. This is logical, conservatively stated completion of the argument. this is a conclusion question, not an inference. The first sentence of the passage does not do any help to the conclusion. The key reason is the second sentence.This question is unlikely to appear in gmat. This question is a bit ridiculous...1200-level question if you ask me:Philosopher: Nations are not literally persons; they have no thoughts or feelings, and, literally speaking, they perform no actions. Thus they have no moral rights or responsibilities. But no nation can survive unless many of its citizens attribute such rights and responsibilities to it, for nothing else could prompt people to make the sacrifices national citizenship demands. Obviously, then, a nation __________.The first sentence tells us a KEY PREMISE that we need to solve this problem:Nations are NOT humans; Nations don't have rights and responsibilities. Thus ONLY humans have rights and responsibilities. (You can argue here that animals/aliens could potentially have rights and responsibilities but the over-usage of ""literally"" tells us that the author is definitely assuming only humans can have them)Then the second sentence says citizens attribute right and responsibilities, combining the logic from above, means that citizens believe nations are human. This is a false belief because of the premise aforementioned. Philosopher: Nations are not literally persons; they have no thoughts or feelings, and, literally speaking, they perform no actions. Thus they have no moral rights or responsibilities. But no nation can survive unless many of its citizens attribute such rights and responsibilities to it, for nothing else could prompt people to make the sacrifices national citizenship demands.

Whether banks are insured by the gov against loan default is irrelevant.

Nowhere is this mentioned in the reasoning. (B) is outQuote:(D) The government limits the insurance protection it provides by insuring accounts up to a certain legally defined amount only.This does not address who should pay. Whether the government limits the insurance protection depending on the amount does not affect the conclusion that Individuals should pay. (D) is out.Quote:(E) The government does not allow banks to offer some kinds of accounts in which deposits are not insured.So this says that all of the account type must be insured. Okay, but who is going to pay for this?

Now It is the only remaining. Should It be the correct answer choice? Let's checkBanks -> not cover INS cost by giving lower IR for Insured-Deposit Account > Uninsured-deposit AccountNegation: Banks lower the IR that ID account can earn to cover the cost of INS. So the UD account is now making more Interest Income than ID account. This is saying that the ID account is paying for it, contradicting the conclusion.

Why is E wrong?Let's stay focused on reading the argument carefully before trying to apply any kind of test to it:Quote:Editorialist: News media rarely cover local politics thoroughly, and local political business is usually conducted secretively. These factors each tend to isolate local politicians from their electorates. This has the effect of reducing the chance that any particular act of resident participation will elicit a positive official response, which in turn discourages resident participation in local politics.This is a lot of information to take in, but the editorialist is basically telling us about a sequence of actions. So let's break up this sequence into individual steps:News media rarely cover local politics thoroughly. At the same time, local political business is usually conducted secretively.These two factors result in the isolation of local politicians from their electorates.The isolation of local politicians from electorates results in a lower chance that any act of resident participation will elicit a positive official response.When there is a lower chance that any act of resident participation will elicit a positive official response, then residents will be discouraged from participating in local politics.Now, is choice (E)supported bythe breakdown above?Quote:(E) If resident participation in local politics were not discouraged, this would cause local politicians to be less isolated from their electorate.Huh? Not discouraging resident participation wouldcauselocal politicians to be less isolated? This seems backwards.The editorialist told us that local politicians become isolated from their electorates.Then, as a result of the isolation,the chance of a positive response due to resident participation goes down.Then, as a result of this chance going down, residents are discouraged from participating in local politics.Choice (E) reads in the opposite direction, which contradicts the entire flow of logic that the argument has set up. So (E) can't be supported by the editorialist's statements. The sequence of events being described just doesn't line up.That's why we can eliminate (E).

Since the question asks the answer choice that the argumentmost strongly supports, we come to choice B, which states the conclusion that X->Z. Other choices just conclude Y->Z so aren't good enough. Anyone please explain to me why A is wrong? minbiebsAnyone please explain to me why A is wrong?Let's take a look at A:Quote:(A) Particular acts of resident participation would belikelyto elicit a positive response from local politicians if those politicians were less isolated from their electorateThe problematic word is ""likely"". We know that the low coverage of local news and secretive conduct of local political businesses leads to isolation of local politicians from their electorate. If these problems were remedied the isolation would be reduced and it would becomemore likelythat resident participation would result in positive responses from local politicians. We just know that the likelihood would increase but we don't know by how much. Hence, we can't state that resident participation would likely result in positive responses.

The problem is that we have no idea how great either of those chances actually are.Maybe an isolated official only responds to one out of a hundred acts of resident participation, and a non-isolated official responds to two out of a hundred such acts.

Although I agree with the premise in the first paragraph, however, rather than relying on 'should be' and 'is' aspects of the world construction as stated in the question stem, I think it would be better to eliminate option B on the criteria that it can wrongfully confer two things:1) 'Less' secretive conduction of political business would be appreciated by the people. It is also possible that people appreciate complete transparency from their politicians. Nothing is stated to correlate the amount of secrecy to the level of discouragement, as opposed to option (D).2) Use of the word 'avoid' discouragement suggests that the feeling of discouragement could be averted entirely by doing as stated.As per the second sentence, I'd like to think that both (B) and (D) are two sides of the same coin,  one however gives off a less hindered shine.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/editorialist-news-media-rarely-cover-local-politics-thoroughly-249597.html

The passage tells us that Jimmy's new water heater is rated as highly efficient. So we would expect the new water heater to be more efficient than the old one. In other words, if both the old heater and the new heater were used to create the same quantity of heat, the new heater should use less gas in doing so.So, as long as the energy requirements of Jimmy's household remain constant, we would expect the gas bill todecrease.However, we know that the gas bill increased. So we're looking for factors that could have caused this increase, such as:Anything that causes more gas to be usedAnything that raises the cost of using gasNow, let's take a closer look at (C):Quote:(C) After having done his laundry at a laundromat, Jimmy bought and started using a gas dryer when he replaced his water heater.This choice introduces agas dryerto the household, which causes more gas to be used. We know the dryer is an entirely new cause of gas usage, because this choice also tells us that Jimmy was previously doing his laundry at the laundromat.

From the argument, it is obvious why the entomologist could be wrong. But how could he be right? What if the particles being carried from the dumping site WERE food particles? That is the only way he could be right.So for Atren's conclusion to follow (that the entomologist was wrong), we need to assume that particles being carried were not food particles.You don't have to get lost in the process.

The retraction could be because of some other reasons. Atrens: An early entomologist observed ants carrying particles to neighboring ant colonies and inferred that the ants were bringing food to their neighbors. Further research, however, revealed that the ants were emptying their own colony’s dumping site. Thus, the early entomologist was wrong.Atrens’s conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?Why would entomologist say that the particles that the ants were carrying were food particles? Because they thought that the dumping sites contained food items and that's how they inferred that the ants were bringing food to their neighbors.BUT they were proved wrong that means we have to eliminate the possibility that the dumping sites contained food. That's exactly what C does. It eliminates the possibility that the dumping sites contained food particles and hence is our answer.(A) Ant societies do not interact in all the same ways that human societies interact.Comparing interactions of ants with that of human societies' interaction is absolutely out of scope.(B) There is only weak evidence for the view that ants have the capacity to make use of objects as gifts.What kind of gift are we talking about about, were they food particles or something else? who knows! Eliminate.(D) The ants to whom the particles were brought never carried the particles into their own colonies.Whether they carried the particles or didn't doesn't really matter and hence this option is out of scope too.(E) The entomologist cited retracted his conclusion when it was determined that the particles the ants carried came from their dumping site.Entomologists changed the mind. Who cares! Does it impact the argument? Absolutely not. Because our argument is based on the fact they said for the first time. this source is from LSAT, i now realize how different LSAT is from GMAT.C is the answer b/c it connects directly with the argument.In LSAT, patterns in options are harder to recognize. generisnightblade354pikolo2510VeritasKarishmaI fell in to (D) for this question and would like to share my reasoning of argument and PoE.Quote:Atrens’s conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?Start with question stem to know what is to be done after reading the argument.This is clearly asking me to find the assumption.Quote:Atrens: An early entomologist observed ants carrying particles to neighbouring ant colonies and inferred that the ants were bringing food to their neighbours. Further research, however, revealed that the ants were emptying their own colony’s dumping site. Thus, the early entomologist was wrong.Start with the conclusion:the early entomologist was wrong.Orthe early entomologist's claim was wrong.entomologist: Eresearch : RAs per E, food = particlesLater research: no, actually ants dump whatever is in their colonies.whatever: may or may not be food.Let me also break down premise and counter-premise for better understanding:An early entomologist observed ants carrying particles to neighbouring ant coloniesFact/ premisethe ants were bringing food to their neighbours.E's claim. Supporting premise for above factFurther research revealed that the ants were emptying their own colony’s dumping site.Counter premise for E's claim and main premisesupporting author's claimThus, the early entomologist was wrong.Author(A) goes against E's claim with above premiseFor a valid assumption to prove: E's claim is wrong:a. We need to support A's claimb. We need to defend against any weakener for E's claim(b) is important since if there is a weakener then it wouldinvalidate E's claimOn argument text as this, I find it easier to simply negate the answer choicesto find the assumption instead of bridging gap between premise and conclusion.For a moment, here is how I would prethink:I need an answer choice that leads to claim:food is not equal to particles(y)because if food = particles then the claim would be invalid.Quote:(A) Ant societies do not interact in all the same ways that human societies interact.Incorrect comparison, the manner in which the ants interact: whether it is similar to humans or notis outside the scope of argument.Quote:(B) There is only weak evidence for the view that ants have thecapacity to make use of objects as gifts.Underlined portion is way too out of scope. If in doubt, negate this choice:There is a strong evidence for the view that ants have the capacity to make use of objects as gifts.Is my claim that ants dump material in their own colonies affected? Nope.Quote:(C) Ant dumping sites do not contain particles that could be used as food.I negated this to get:Ant dumping sites do  contain particles that could be used as food.OK, so particles = foodWhat am I supposed to do?to find an evidence that makes me invalidates my claim:ants do carry food in terms of particlesI just got lost to think too much in my head and could not check how this fits.Quote:(D) The ants to whom the particles were brought never carried the particles into their own colonies.Negate this, The ants to whom the particles were brought ALWAYS carried the particles into their own coloniesSo let s say Ants carry particles from X to Z. This options talks about ants in Z.It says ants in Z bring their own particles.Then how can I say that other ants bring particles in to Z?I selected this answer choice since I felt it supported A's claimQuote:(E) The entomologist cited retracted his conclusion when it was determined that the particles the ants carried came from their dumping site.Whether E retracted from his conclusion after finding the new evidence is outside the scope of argument.Overall, I think my approach faltered in pieces while connecting counter-premise to claim andfurthermore, when we are asked to prove:claim in invalidthan to prove:claim is valid.Not sure, if I am handling too many negatives in this question.Let me know your approach to this question. Thanks a tonne for the explanationVeritasKarishmamam...Just likeadkikaniI got too much lost in overthinking the answer choices and ended up marking incorrect answer choice Heyadkikani, i am not an expert, but since i answered the question correctly, here is my reasoning. i generally dont break any argument into premises, conclusions etc - i simply read an argument and use a common sense.My approach is called K.I.S.S.  - Keep It Simple and Stupid.Entomologist says that he saw ants carrying something to neighbour ants.  Initially entomologist claimed that this ""something"" was food, but at the end of the day his obeservation turned out to be inaccurate.To understand why C is correct, you need to understand why D is incorrect.D says: (D) The ants to whom the particles were broughtnevercarried the particles into their own colonies.Pay attention to word NEVER. when making an assumption avoid such extreme options unless there is HINT to word NEVER in the argument.  You cant be sure of word NEVER in option C, since you dont know this information FOR SURE.now using POE you can easily pick C.well that was my reasoninghave a great day! Atrens: An early entomologist observed ants carrying particles to neighboring ant colonies and inferred that the ants were bringing food to their neighbors. Further research, however, revealed that theants were emptying their own colony’s dumping site.

But what is the relation between emptying dumping site and food that ants carry. Early entomologist never in the passage mentioned that food was carried from dumping site and Atren never mentioned that food was carried from dumping site. Hence Atren suggests that dumping site could not have had food that ants carry.Only B and C have some chance, others are irrelevant.B loses out since even a weak evidence tells us that ants carried gifts and that too if we consider food as gift.Answer C._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More",https://gmatclub.com/forum/atrens-an-early-entomologist-observed-ants-carrying-249600.html

While the argument only says that Cognitve psychotherapy is more effective than other forms that concerntrate on unconcious beliefs. This implies that other forms of psychotheapy are also somewhat effective. Hence ""D"" is incorrect.B makes a comparison by saying that it is difficult for other forms to be effective. This implies, though difficult, other forms can be effective. The statement is in line with the argument.Please let me know if my line of reasoning is correct.ThanksBefore digging this deeply into the choices, let's refresh on what argument we're analyzing in the first place.Quote:Therapist: Cognitive psychotherapy focuses on changing a patient’s conscious beliefs. Thus, cognitive psychotherapy is likely to be more effective at helping patients overcome psychological problems than are forms of psychotherapy that focus on changing unconscious beliefs and desires, since only conscious beliefs are under the patient’s direct conscious control.The therapist's conclusion is:Cognitive psychotherapy is likely to be more effective at helping patients overcome psychological problemsthan psychotherapies that focus on changing unconscious beliefs and desires.Breaking it down a bit further:Cognitive psychotherapy (let's call it CP) focuses on changing a patient'sconscious beliefs.Only conscious beliefs are under the patient's direct conscious control.This implies that CP focuses on beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control.Other forms of psychotherapy (let's call them ""other psychotherapies,"" or OPs) focus on changingunconscious beliefs and desires.The Therapist concludes that CP is more effective than OPs at helping patients overcome psychological problems.Quote:Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the therapist’s argument?We have a gap in the logic here, because nothing in the argument explains why focusing on beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control would be more effective at helping patients than focusing on changing unconscious beliefs. The correct answer choice is the one that most strongly fills this gap.Quote:(B) It is difficult for any form of psychotherapy to be effective without focusing on mental states that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.(B) is quite explicit about which forms of psychotherapy areeffective or not effective. This choice tells us that efficacy is difficult to achieve for any form of psychotherapy that doesn't focus on direct conscious control (including OPs). Here's what this looks like when we plug it into our breakdown of the argument:CP focuses on changing beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control.OPs focus on changing unconscious beliefs and desires.It's difficult for any psychotherapy to be effective, if that psychotherapy does not focus on direct conscious control.Therefore, CP is more effective than OPs at helping patients overcome psychological problems.This fills our logical gap directly, so we'll keep (B) around.Quote:(D) No form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing the patient’s unconscious beliefs and desires can be effective unless it also helps change beliefs that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.The first thing that jumps out at me is that this choice only offers information about OPs. And remember thatwe can't consider the information we just read in choice (B)as we read this new answer choice.So far, we have no new information about the efficacy of CP. Instead, (D) states that no OPs can be effective unless it also helps change beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control. When we plug this information back into the information we're given in the passage, here's where things stand:CP focuses on changing beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control.OPs focus on changing unconscious beliefs and desires.OPs can be effective if they also help change beliefs under the patient's direct conscious control.Therefore, CP is more effective than OPs at helping patients overcome psychological problems.This new information doesn't give us any reason to believe that CPs are more effective than OPs. In fact, this opens the possibility that an OP could be just as effective as CP, as long as the OP also helps change beliefs that are under direct conscious control.Either way, Choice (D) does nothing to strengthen the argument. This is why we keep (B) and eliminate (D).Whew, after working on this CR question, I need an extra hour of therapy myself.

Cognitive psychotherapy's focus is conscious beliefs.2. Patients can ONLY directly control conscious beliefs. => Cognitive psychotherapy (aka focusing on Conscious) beliefs are more EFFECTIVE than other forms of psychotherapyWhat's the gap here? It's pretty clear from the 2nd point that we have an assumption:PATIENT's DIRECT CONTROL = MORE EFFECTIVE.Let's scan through the answer choices to find something that is related to the gap.(A) Psychological problems are frequently caused by unconscious beliefs that could be changed with the aid of psychotherapy.-Out of scope, we are trying to argue why Cognitive psychotherapy is EFFECTIVE.(B) It is difficult for any form of psychotherapy to be effective without focusing on mental states that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.-In other words, TO BE an effective form of psychotherapy, IT MUST FOCUS on mental states (or conscious) that are DIRECTLY UNDER PATIENTS CONTROL. This is basically stating our gap and assumption!!(C) Cognitive psychotherapy is the only form of psychotherapy that focuses primarily on changing the patient’s conscious beliefs.-Just because it is the only one..doesn't mean it is EFFECTIVE. This doesn't help our argument.(D) No form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing the patient’s unconscious beliefs and desires can be effective unless it also helps change beliefs that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.-In other words, TO be EFFECTIVE on changing patient's unconscious beliefs we ALSO NEED to change conscious beliefs. This is tricky..let's rewind a bit and look at what exactly are we trying to prove. What we do mean when we say Cognitive psychotherapy are more effective. Reading the stem again, we get ""cognitive psychotherapy is likely to be more effective at helping patients overcome psychological problems than..."". Looks like we are looking at EFFECTIVE in ""overcome psychological problems"" NOT ""changing unconscious beliefs"". Therefore this is OUT of scope!(E) All of a patient’s conscious beliefs are under the patient’s conscious control, but other psychological states cannot be controlled effectively without the aid of psychotherapy.-Obvious out of scope. We don't care what the patient can control. We are trying to prove IF Cognitive psychotherapy is more effective than other types of psychotherapyB is the winner here. OE fromMGMAT:What’s the assumption? The author assumes that in order to be effective, a treatment must address mental processes that are under the control of the patient. This is easy to miss, but it’s an important assumption that is critical to the argument. We can strengthen the argument by making this assumption explicit. Answer (B) does this.(A) weakens the argument.(C) is irrelevant. It doesn’t matter if it’s the only form of therapy that focuses on conscious beliefs. The argument deals only with cognitive psychotherapy vs. other forms of psychotherapy that do NOT focus on conscious beliefs.(D) strengthens the argument by providing an additional piece of supporting evidence, but it does not strengthen as much as answer (B). An answer that fills a gap in the argument will generally strengthen the most (since the argument is weak with the gap).(E) fails to provide any information comparing the two types of therapy._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

Hi,I have a confusion between option B and D.B says that psychotherapies which do not focus on mental states are not as effective as ones that do. This strengthens the conclusion, in fact, I would go even further and say this is, in fact, the author's assumption. (Negate it and the conclusion falls apart)D says that no form of psychotherapy can be effective till it changes conscious beliefs. Although this is an exaggeration, it does increase my belief in the conclusion that possibly cognitive psychotherapy, since it changes conscious beliefs, is likely to be effective. I am not sure how to eliminate D.Is it because changing conscious beliefs is a necessary condition and not a sufficient one for psychotherapy to be active? That is even if a psychotherapy changes conscious beliefs, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than a therapy which does not?Many thanks. Ah, we know we're in LSAT land when we get this deep into sufficient and necessary. If you want a good treatment of that, check out my friend Patrick's analysis here (the post from March 21, 2012):https://www.manhattanprep.com/lsat/foru ... tml#p15880In a nutshell, the crucial difference between B and D is that D talks about ""helping to change beliefs"" while B addresses ""focusing"" on states under conscious control. The latter fits well with the argument. The problem with ""helping"" is that perhaps we could help change conscious beliefs without actively focusing them. In other words, if I'm receiving therapy that focuses on the unconscious, then it seems clear enough that I'm not focusing on the conscious, so B kicks in and helps us. However, we don't know whether that therapy ishelpingme to change my conscious beliefs, so D does not necessarily apply._________________Dmitry Farber | Manhattan Prep GMAT Instructor | San DiegoManhattan GMAT Discount|Manhattan GMAT Course Reviews|View Instructor ProfileSignature Read More guysthis seems to be very complex. is this limited only to LSAT or even GMAT has such tough questions?

This is definitely a more LSAT-like question. One of the big differences in the LSAT is that it focuses heavily on conditional logic. To do well on the LSAT, you need to have a strong grasp of sufficient vs. necessary and you will often need to diagram arguments using conditional notation. We can generally get through the GMAT without any of this.Short answer, for those who are worried: no, you're not likely to see something like this on the GMAT._________________Dmitry Farber | Manhattan Prep GMAT Instructor | San DiegoManhattan GMAT Discount|Manhattan GMAT Course Reviews|View Instructor ProfileSignature Read More Another way to think about the difficulty is that while it may not be the hardest LSAT question of all time, it tests skills that GMAT students won't typically have been working on.

LSAT are not very exact here. A mental state, like sadness, is not even close to the definition of a belief.Posted from my mobile deviceEdit: I was gone. I thought a mental state was the same thing as an emotional state. The definition, however, is more general: ""Mental states comprise a diverse class including perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention, emotion and memory."" Quote:(D) No form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing the patient’s unconscious beliefs and desires can be effective unless it also helps change beliefs that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.If you look closely, you can see that option D is a weakener. It says that even if we take the case of another form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing the patient’s unconscious beliefs and desires, that form of psychotherapy will only be effective if it also changes beliefs that are under the patient’s direct conscious control.Then how can we say that one form of psychotherapy is better than another?",https://gmatclub.com/forum/therapist-cognitive-psychotherapy-focuses-on-changing-a-249606.html

Exercising the muscles on opposite sides of the spineunequally tends to lead tounbalanced muscle development.Since we have two negative words we can paraphrase the sentence as below;Exercising the muscles on opposite sides of the spineequallytends to lead tobalancedmuscle development.So, by negating we get,Exercising the muscles on opposite sides of the spineDOES NOTequallytends to lead tobalancedmuscle development.This breaks down the conclusion, thereby, it is a correct assumption.Hi Mahmud6,Yes option B by negating, we can see the conclusion breaks. Can you kindly mention how C is incorrect. Even by negating C, the conclusion breaks.Hisunny91,Though I am still learning, I will try to present my reasoning.The word 'generally' means 'in most cases' or 'usually'. So, to paraphrase the choice C, it stands-'provided that one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, one will have a healthy backin most cases'So, by negating we get,'provided that one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, one willNOThave a healthy backin most cases---> which indicates that if one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally,in some cases one will have a healthy back.I hope this doesn't break down the conclusion.ThanksMahmud6for the reply!Let's look at the passage in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. We are told that ""balanced muscle developmentis neededto maintain a healthy back"". Does that mean that balanced muscle development is SUFFICIENT to maintain a healthy back? Maybe not. Consider the following example:A great GMAT score is needed to get accepted to LBS.So if you get a great GMAT score, will you get accepted to LBS? Maybe, maybe not. Getting a great GMAT score is a NECESSARY condition, but it is not sufficient. You might need a great GMAT score, an outstanding essay, solid referrals, impressive work experience, etc. Similarly, having balanced muscle development is NECESSARY to maintaining a healthy back, but it might not be sufficient. You might need balanced muscle development, lots of flexibility, great posture, healthy vertebrae, etc.Now take a look at choice (C):Quote:(C) Provided that one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, one will have a generally healthy back.Just because you exercise the muscles on opposite sides equally, does not necessarily mean you'll have balanced muscle development. And even if you have balanced muscle development, you might have an unhealthy back for other reasons.The passage describes a NECESSARY condition, but choice (C) turns it into a (generally) SUFFICIENT condition. 100 people might have balanced muscle development, but half of them (or more) might have unhealthy backs for other reasons. This doesn't change the fact that having balanced muscle development is a NECESSARY condition. Thus, choice (C) is not a required assumption.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Premise: When exercising the muscles in one’s back, it is important, in order to maintain a healthy back, to exercise the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally.Conclusion:balanced muscle development is needed to maintain a healthy backPremise: since the muscles on opposite sides of the spine must pull equally in opposing directions to keep the back in proper alignment and protect the spine.Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?(A) Muscles on opposite sides of the spine that are equally well developed will be enough to keep the back in proper alignment.

C looks more like an inference or conclusion to me. but, on a second thought C can be an assumption, that falls under If X then Y.(C) Provided that one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, one will have a generally healthy back.If one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, then one will have a generally healthy back.If we negate this, if one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, then one will not have a generally healthy back. The argument falls. Please help me to understand how to eliminate C. broallWhen exercising the muscles in one’s back, it is important, in order to maintain a healthy back, to exercise the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally.

I  was unable to understand the reasoning behind A being the right answer choice.HiLet me try to address your query. The argument is structured as below:Voters elect politicians who promise that the government will provide assistance to solve their most pressing problems (P) --> Governmental assistance costs money (Q) --> Money can come only from taxes (R) --> Taxes can be considered a form of governmental intrusion (S) --> S will not substantially reduce over time.So the argument makes the point that since (P) happens, S will not reduce over time in a democracy. This clearly makes an underlying assumption that politicians will actually implement P upon being elected.Option (A) states that explicitly, which strengthens the argument. If we negate option (A) [ie; assume that politicians do not keep their campaign promises], then P does not occur and hence the overall argument also fails. This too shows (A) to be the correct answer.Hope this helps._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More yash312(C) The most common problems people have are financial problems.I think that This option states That "" SInce most people have financial problem, so people will be needing financial assistance, so they need sustenance from govt, and govt will provide sustenance from the money obtained in the form of tax from people""As a result of which the govt intrusion will never stop and cycle continues.please explain where I am wrong in thinkingI understand A is correct answer, but guide me to understand the wrongness in my thinking in option CI initially picked A and it's a good answer.The problem is I agree with Yash, C is also compelling.Voters elect people who will provide them with assistance....but that assistance costs money.

It implies that politicians works against an ungainly apparatus which they cant do much about anyway.

"Eight years ago hunting was banned in Greenfield County on the grounds that hunting endangers public safety. Now the deer population in the county is six times what it was before the ban. Deer are invading residential areas, damaging property and causing motor vehicle accidents that result in serious injury to motorists.

The questions asks, ""Which one of the following, if true, provides the strongestadditionalsupport for the conclusion above?"", and choice B doesn't give us anyadditionalsupport...Quote:(B) Motor vehicle accidents involving deer often result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both.Even if this statement is true, it doesn't tell us anything about the number of motor vehicle accidents in Greenfield County. In other words, while it may be true that motor vehicle accidents involving deer often result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both, nothing in choice B tells us how often such accidents actually occur in Greenfield County, if at all. And even if such accidents do occur and, say 90% of those accidents result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both, it is possible that most of that 90% is comprised of accidents that only result in damage to the vehicle. Choice B only tell us thatsomemotor vehicle accidents involving deer result in injury to the motorist, but it gives us no idea of how often such injuries occur or of how serious those injuries are. The passage already states that deer are causing motor vehicles accidents that result inseriousinjury to motorists; since choice B does not tell us anything about the frequency of such accidents and injuries in Greenfield County or the seriousness of those injuries, it does not provide any additional support.Choice A, on the other hand, gives us additional information that strongly supports the conclusion. The argument is based on the assumption that the hunting ban caused the increase in the deer population, but it is certainly possible that other factors led to the increase. Choice A provides evidence that the ban was, in fact, the cause of the population increase, thus strengthening the argument._________________www.gmatninja.com(Bio)A GMAT TUTOR STRUGGLES WITH GMAT ANXIETY, VOL. 3Videos:How to get the most out of official GMAT quantitative questionsHow to make your own GMAT practice testsHow to manage time on an adaptive test like the GMATSix GMAT time management myths you should never buy intoSignature Read More nahid78Eight years ago hunting was banned in Greenfield County on the grounds that hunting endangers public safety.

The questions asks, ""Which one of the following, if true, provides the strongestadditionalsupport for the conclusion above?"", and choice B doesn't give us anyadditionalsupport...Quote:(B) Motor vehicle accidents involving deer often result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both.Even if this statement is true, it doesn't tell us anything about the number of motor vehicle accidents in Greenfield County. In other words, while it may be true that motor vehicle accidents involving deer often result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both, nothing in choice B tells us how often such accidents actually occur in Greenfield County, if at all. And even if such accidents do occur and, say 90% of those accidents result in damage to the vehicle, injury to the motorist, or both, it is possible that most of that 90% is comprised of accidents that only result in damage to the vehicle. Choice B only tell us thatsomemotor vehicle accidents involving deer result in injury to the motorist, but it gives us no idea of how often such injuries occur or of how serious those injuries are. The passage already states that deer are causing motor vehicles accidents that result inseriousinjury to motorists; since choice B does not tell us anything about the frequency of such accidents and injuries in Greenfield County or the seriousness of those injuries, it does not provide any additional support.Choice A, on the other hand, gives us additional information that strongly supports the conclusion. The argument is based on the assumption that the hunting ban caused the increase in the deer population, but it is certainly possible that other factors led to the increase. Choice A provides evidence that the ban was, in fact, the cause of the population increase, thus strengthening the argument.Hello Mr Ninja,I don't like this question for one simple reason. B is eliminated ONLY because it repeats a piece of information from the prompt.There are some GMAT questions like this. I have learned to except this fact & use it. Whenever, you have to chose between 2 options and one of them repeats the info from the prompt, go for the other. It is so 'dumb' and mechanical to be honest and not really sound reasoning.Unfortunate that these questions do exist. I can ONLY hope that these ""lazy"" questions go away. GMAC spends 3k per qn, apparently. And you get this for 3k+. Someone is not doing his / her job.. Unfortunately, I can curse all I want but it is their exam!!Yes, I noticed how you ""went all in on one word in the question"" - Additional. Yes, that's a good strategy and works. I have noticed that in CR questions. But, I don't like that either though this is lesser of the 2 evils (prefer this over the ""eliminate because it repeats from the prompt"").

If dogs are behaving oddly at any given time and we base our earthquake predictions on the odd behavior of dogs, that would mean we would predict an impending earthquake at any given time; thus, according to the skeptics, the odd behavior of dogs cannot be used to predict earthquakes. But what if there was aspecific typeof odd behavior demonstrated by dogs just before earthquakes? For example, what if just before an earthquake, dogs tended to stand up on their hind legs and pace back and forth nervously? Even though some of the world's dogs may be behaving oddly at any given time, as stated by the skeptic, if we only see this specific type of odd behavior prior to earthquakes, then we could use this odd behavior to predict impending earthquakes._________________www.gmatninja.com(Bio)A GMAT TUTOR STRUGGLES WITH GMAT ANXIETY, VOL. 3Videos:How to get the most out of official GMAT quantitative questionsHow to make your own GMAT practice testsHow to manage time on an adaptive test like the GMATSix GMAT time management myths you should never buy intoSignature Read More nahid78There is a widespread belief that people can predict impending earthquakes from unusual animal behavior.

'We need to evaluate this position.How can we weaken this position. If we can prove that the behaviour is not coincidental.What if the animals behaved differently prior to an earthquake compared to when they normally behave oddly.If yes then the conclusion is weakened. If no conclusion is falsified. This is stated in E.As to D, even if they are as pronounced as in other animals how does this affect the skeptics conclusion. It doesn't.This choice doesn't address the skeptics conclusion.Hence Wrong IMO.hope Its clear. Pre-thinking helped me here. In evaluate question, identifying the assumption is the key. Here, the skeptics assume that the dogs usual odd behaviour is similar or comparable to the their behaviour just before an earthquake. Hence, E is the answer. Choice D is irrelevant to evaluate the given position. There is a widespread belief that people can predict impending earthquakes from unusual animal behavior. Skeptics claim that this belief is based on selective coincidence: people whose dogs behaved oddly just before an earthquake will be especially likely to remember that fact. At any given time, the skeptics say, some of the world’s dogs will be behaving oddly.The skeptics' position is that the belief that animal behavior can indicate an impending earthquake is erroneously based on selective coincidence: people are just more likely to remember their dogs' behavior if it happened right before an earthquake.Well, okay, but is that behavior connected with earthquakes or not? In other words, is the dog behavior just the same old stuff the dogs would be doing normally, or is it something they only do when an earthquake is on its way?Clarification of which one of the following issues would be most important to an evaluation of the skeptics’ position?(A) Which is larger, the number of skeptics or the number of people who believe that animal behavior can foreshadow earthquakes? -- Out of scope(B) Are there means other than the observation of animal behavior that non-scientists can use to predict earthquakes? -- Out of scope(C) Are there animals about whose behavior people know too little to be able to distinguish unusual from everyday behavior? --doesn't help us evaluate the skeptics' position. Why? Because even if the answer is ""yes,"" that still doesn't mean that there are no animals whose behavior we can accurately judge. In other words, maybe we can't distinguish unusual marmoset behavior from everyday marmoset behavior, but we can still distinguish normal and unusual dog behavior.(D) Are the sorts of behavior supposedly predictive of earthquakes as pronounced in dogs as they are in other animals? -- Whether or not unusual behavior in more pronounced in other animals, the issue of selective memory remains.

In other words, is there certain unusual behavior that the animals display ONLY before earthquakes?For example, dogs certainly do plenty of odd things: chase their own tails, do back-flips, lie down in funny positions, etc.As the skeptics point out, at any given time, some dogs in the world will be doing something odd.So whenever there is an earthquake, there were likely dogs doing odd things just before the earthquake.Thus, the odd behavior is probably just a coincidence and has nothing to do with the earthquakes.But what if there is a specific odd behavior that dogs ONLY do before an earthquake?For example, what if just before an earthquake, dogs tend to stand up on their hind legs and pace back and forth nervously?This is something that dogs ONLY do before an earthquake.In that case, the odd pacing behavior would bespecificto impending earthquakes.So choice (E) says, ""Is there a SPECIFIC kind of odd behavior that animals display before earthquakes (i.e. pacing back and forth) or can it be ANY kind of odd behavior (i.e. chasing tails, doing backflips, etc)?""If it's just ANY kind of odd behavior, then the skeptics are probably right.If animals display SPECIFIC odd behavior prior to an earthquake, then the skeptics' position is probably flawed.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Thank you so muchGMATNinja.

Intermediate conclusion (i.e. conclusion of above premise and premise for final conclusion below):  investigators ignore anything that does not directly bear on the funded research.III. Final conclusion: serendipity can no longer play a role in scientific discovery.Option B does not link any of the premise-conclusion link ( i.e I to II or II to III).

Cars without antitheft devices should be stolen in equal, if not more, quantity. tinbqHi experts,Please help to explain why each choice is right or wrong. Thanks.We are looking for the answer choice that is thestrongestin resolving the paradox.Let’s first identify what the paradox is. We have two supposedly conflicting pieces of evidence:1) Police statistics that show that antitheft devicesreducethe risk of car theft, and2) the insurance industry statistics that show that cars equipped with antitheft devices aremore likelyto be stolen than cars without the antitheft devices.So the paradox to resolve is: if antitheft devices reduce the risk of car theft, why are cars equipped with antitheft devices statistically more likely to be stolen?Ok, let’s look at the answer choices:Quote:(A) Owners of stolen cars almost invariably report the theft immediately to the police but tend to delay notifying their insurance company, in the hope that the vehicle will be recovered.This onecouldexplain why the police would receive more reports of stolen cars than the auto insurance industry--owners of stolen cars report theft incidents to the police immediately, and some of those incidentsmightnot end up being reported to the insurance companies (for example, if a stolen vehicle is quickly recovered without any damage).But even if the police do receive more reports of stolen cars, we don’t know whether those stolen cars had antitheft devices. This choice therefore doesn’t give us the statistical information we’d need to resolve the paradox. Let’s get rid of (A).Quote:(B) Most cars that are stolen are not equipped with antitheft devices, and most cars that are equipped with antitheft devices are not stolen.This choice seems to support the police statistics, but it doesn't explain the insurance industry's statistics suggesting that ""cars equipped with antitheft devices are, paradoxically, more likely to be stolen than cars that are not so equipped.""Because (B) only supports one side of the paradox and not both, it doesn't resolve the discrepancy. We can eliminate (B).Quote:(C) The most common automobile antitheft devices are audible alarms, which typically produce ten false alarms for every actual attempted theft.In this statement, we are given information about how many times the antitheft devices wereactivated, regardless of whether the car was stolen. But to resolve the paradox in the passage, we only care about cars that were stolen.Because (C) doesn't actually give us any information about the number ofstolencars, it does not resolve the paradox. We can eliminate (C).Quote:(D) Automobile owners who have particularly theft-prone cars and live in areas of greatest incidence of car theft are those who are most likely to have antitheft devices installed.As we discussed in anearlier post, (D) provides an explanation for both sides of the paradox:... The insurance companies' claim could be true, because theft-prone cars in risky areas are more likely to be stolen. If these are the cars with anti-theft devices installed, then it explains why they are stolen more frequently than other cars.At the same time, the police statistics could be true -- installing anti-theft devices could reduce theoverallrate of car theft, even if cars with the antitheft devices are stolen more frequently. Note: we do not need to assume that anti-theft devices reduce the risk of car theft, because this information is given to us in the passage. (D) provides additional information that explains how this is possible, given the surprising finding of the study conducted by the insurance industry.Here is an example to illustrate how (D) resolves the paradox:Car thefts BEFORE installing antitheft devices:Less risky location: 100More risky location: 1000Total: 1100Car thefts AFTER installing antitheft devices:Less risky location (no antitheft devices installed): 100More risky location (lots of antitheft devices installed): 500Total: 600Here, we see that the overall number of car thefts has been reduced by installing antitheft devices. However, we can also see that theft-prone cars with antitheft devices could be more likely to be stolen, because they are located in a risky area.Let’s keep (D) for now.Quote:(E) Most automobile thefts are the work of professional thieves against whose efforts antitheft devices offer scant protection.If (E) is true, we would expect very little difference between the theft rate of cars WITH antitheft devices and the theft rate of cars WITHOUT antitheft (if anything, the theft rate might be a little bit smaller for cars with antitheft--though the antitheft devices only offerscantprotection, they still might offersomeprotection).So, at best, (E)mightbe consistent with the police statistics (if there is, in fact, a slightly lower theft rate for cars with antitheft). But then why do the insurance statistics suggest that cars WITH antitheft are more likely to be stolen than cars WITHOUT antitheft? While (E) may or may not explain the police statistics, it certainly does not explain the insurance statistics or resolve the paradox. We can eliminate (E).By process of elimination, the answer is (D).I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More vaivish1723Police statistics have shown that automobile antitheft devices reduce the risk of car theft, but a statistical study of automobile theft by the automobile insurance industry claims that cars equipped with antitheft devices are, paradoxically, more likely to be stolen than cars that are not so equipped.Which one of the following, if true, does the most to resolve the apparent paradox?(A) Owners of stolen cars almost invariably report the theft immediately to the police but tend to delay notifying their insurance company, in the hope that the vehicle will be recovered.(B) Most cars that are stolen are not equipped with antitheft devices, and most cars that are equipped with antitheft devices are not stolen.(C) The most common automobile antitheft devices are audible alarms, which typically produce ten false alarms for every actual attempted theft.(D) Automobile owners who have particularly theft-prone cars and live in areas of greatest incidence of car theft are those who are most likely to have antitheft devices installed.(E) Most automobile thefts are the work of professional thieves against whose efforts antitheft devices offer scant protection.OFFICIAL EXPLANATION(A) No. This would make the insurance industry statistics show a lower theft rate.(B) No. The conclusion concerns the difference in rates of car theft in two categories (a percentage), not with absolute numbers.(C) No. This is irrelevant.(D) Yes.This resolves the paradox well. If the owners of cars with antitheft devices live in areas with high rates of car theft, then even if the devices help prevent car thefts their cars may still be more likely to be stolen than cars without antitheft devices in areas with little or no car theft. Another possible explanation is that the antitheft devices are more likely to be installed on expensive cars, which are more often the target of thieves.(E) No. According to the passage, police statistics do show that automobile antitheft devices reduce the risk of car theft._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More This question still confuses me.

The apparent paradox that we have to explain is that cars equipped with anti-theft devices are more likely to be stolen than cars that are not so equipped. In other words, one would think that cars equipped with anti-theft devices would be LESS likely to be stolen than cars without anti-theft devices. Why is this not the case?Quote:(D) Automobile owners who have particularly theft-prone cars and live in areas of greatest incidence of car theft are those who are most likely to have antitheft devices installed.Choice (D) explains the paradox by suggesting that cars with anti-theft devices would be even MORE prone to theft without the devices. In other words, even though cars with the devices get stolen a lot, those cars would get stolen at a higher rate without the devices. So the devices DO in fact reduce the risk of car theft, as shown by the police statistics. However, despite this reduction, those cars are still more likely to be stolen than cars without such devices.Choice (D) explains both the insurance industry claims and the police statistics.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More GMATNinjaCould I possibly ask you for the reason why B doesn't work?

Thanks. tinbqHi experts,Please help to explain why each choice is right or wrong. Thanks.Pre-thinking:The two paradoxical facts are:i) Anti theft devices prevent thefts as per police recordsii) Cars with antitheft devices are more likely to be stolen as per insurance statisticsLet us examine the answer options:(A) Owners of stolen cars almost invariably report the theft immediately to the police but tend to delay notifying their insurance company, in the hope that the vehicle will be recovered.Police statistics show lower thefts of cars with antitheft devices. If owners report promptly to police, we expect police to show more thefts. Despite this, the police records show low theft. Hence, the paradox becomes even more acute. Eliminate.(B) Most cars that are stolen are not equipped with antitheft devices, and most cars that are equipped with antitheft devices are not stolen.This does not address the police or insurance statistics in any way, which is essential to resolve the paradox. Eliminate.(C) The most common automobile antitheft devices are audible alarms, which typically produce ten false alarms for every actual attempted theft.Same problem as (B). Eliminate.(D) Automobile owners who have particularly theft-prone cars and live in areas of greatest incidence of car theft are those who are most likely to have antitheft devices installed.This partly explains the paradox - it is not the antitheft devices which are causing thefts but the possibility of theft which leads to antitheft devices. If greater probability of theft leads to more antitheft devices, we are likely to see the observation seen by insurance companies. However, this does not explain why the police see lower thefts in cars with antitheft devices. Given we have ruled out three options, we can hold on to this for now.(E) Most automobile thefts are the work of professional thieves against whose efforts antitheft devices offer scant protection.If this were true, antitheft devices should not show any relationship to thefts. This neither explains police statistics nor those of insurance companies. Eliminate.While I am not completely satisfied with option (D), at least it explains part of the paradox. None of the other options explain even one part of the paradox. Hence, of the given options, option (D) is the best choice.Hope this helps._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More Ans:D(A) Owners of stolen cars almost invariably report the theft immediately to the police but tend to delay notifying their insurance company, in the hope that the vehicle will be recovered.(B) Most cars that are stolen are not equipped with antitheft devices, and most cars that are equipped with antitheft devices are not stolen.(C) The most common automobile antitheft devices are audible alarms, which typically produce ten false alarms for every actual attempted theft.(D) Automobile owners who have particularly theft-prone cars and live in areas of greatest incidence of car theft are those who are most likely to have antitheft devices installed.(E) Most automobile thefts are the work of professional thieves against whose efforts antitheft devices offer scant protection.

You are answering the wrong question. We do not need to explain the increase in consumption.We need to explain this apparent paradox: increased consumption of oil should have decreased oil reserve levels.

That discrepancy needs to be explained.I am not sure what went wrong.Whyis the ""same volume of oil"" available for extraction? There should be LESS.Option D does not explain the disparity. Option D probably makes things worse.1) A price drop does not explain the seeming contradiction between escalated consumption and oil reserves whose levels stayed the same although no new oil fields were discovered.A lower price cannot explain how available reserve levels can be the same as 10 years ago.

This also means that the consumption of domestic oil has increased (not more than imported oil but has increased definitely). If this is the case we expect the level to be lower than what it was a decade ago(B) Conservation measures have lowered the rate of growth of domestic oil consumption from what it was a decade ago.Again, it says conservation measures have lowered the rate of growth of domestic oil consumption.

He is not concerned with the causes of global warming.(B) No. George stated all the relevant information need on this point: the leaves turned color three weeks later into fall than usual.(C) No. George’s conclusion is that global warming is already occurring. He is not concerned with the causes of global warming.(D) No. George’s argument concerns global warming. He does not address issues of pollution.(E) Yes.The unusually warm weather may only be a local phenomenon. It needs to be determined whether similar changes are occurring elsewhere before the climatic shifts can be consideredglobalwarming._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More E! Reasoning:noboruGeorge: Some scientists say that global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuels. We can see, though, that the predicted warming is occurring already. In the middle of last winter, we had a month of springlike weather in our area, and this fall, because of unusually mild temperatures, the leaves on our town’s trees were three weeks late in turning color.Which one of the following would it be most relevant to investigate in evaluating the conclusion of George’s argument?So we need to isolate George's conclusion. Not too hard: ""the predicted warming is occurring already"".What's his evidence? He gives two examples and they're BOTH tied to ""unusually mild temperatures"" (one is stated outright, the other implied).We'll need to see if his evidence is up to snuff since that's what his conclusion is built upon:(A) whether carbon dioxide is the only cause of global warming.The cause of Global Warming is not what George is talking about. He is saying ""whatever the reason, that **** is going down NOW, yo"" (George is a bit of a gangsta).(B) when leaves on the trees in the town usually change colorI think this answer is here to trick you. Yes, it would be good to know this to see if maybe George is just wrong about his autumn example but it doesn't encompass the entirety of the evidence he put forth. We need to tackle the issue of oddly warm temperature.(C) what proportion of global emissions of carbon dioxide is due to the burning of trees by humansLike A, this about the mechanics of Global Warming. Out of scope.(D) whether air pollution is causing some trees in the are to lose their leavesAgain this would be trying to dismantle George's autumn example in finding a third variable. Commendable, but ultimately it falls short.(E) whether unusually warm weather is occurring elsewhere on the globe more frequently than beforeBingo. Not only does this address the fuller scope of George's evidence, it also looks into whether or not the weird weather is actually global. This is by far the best answer, and if it's not right then that **** be wack, yo. noboruGeorge: Some scientists say that global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuels.

Premise 1: Burn trees/Fossil fuels -> Carbon dioxide -> Will cause Global WarmingConclusion : Global warming is occurring alreadyPremise 2: last winter -> a month of springlike weather in our area, and this fall -> the leaves were three weeks late in turning color(A) whether carbon dioxide is the only cause of global warmingConsider it to be true : Doesn't increase the likelihood of the conclusionConsider it to be false : Doesn't decrease the likelihood of the conclusion(E) whether unusually warm weather is occurring elsewhere on the globe more frequently than beforeConsider it to be true : Increases the likelihood of the conclusion -> Warming is taking place all overConsider it to be false : Decreases the likelihood of the conclusion -> There is some specific exceptional scenario in the author's city.Hence E is the correct answer.I hope it clarifies the doubt!! Premise 1--> global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuelsConclusion 2 --> GB is already occurring.Premise 2 --> In the middle of last winter, we had a month of springlike weather in our area, and this fall, because of unusually mild temperatures, the leaves on our town’s trees were three weeks late in turning color.Evaluate the conclusion: Conclusion says that GB has already occurred because of Premise 2.AC will be any statement which calls into question the premise 2 based on which conclusion is made. and not premise 1 as no conclusion is made based on it(This is the reason AC (A) is wrong!!)Hence AC (E) attacks Premise 2 based on which conclusion is made!Extremes Test : Extreme 1, Yes warming is happening in a lot of cities already. This strengthens the conclusion made on the basis of Premise 1Extreme 2, No warming is not happening anywhere else other than George's city. It means Premise 2 is only specific to the author's city and is not generic. Hence it is not due to GB but something else.! George: Some scientists say that global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuels. We can see, though, that the predicted warming is occurring already. In the middle of last winter, we had a month of springlike weather in our area, and this fall, because of unusually mild temperatures, the leaves on our town’s trees were three weeks late in turning color.Which one of the following would it be most relevant to investigate in evaluating the conclusion of George’s argument?Conc: Global warming is already occurringPrem: Weather in my area is weirdly warmPre-thinking - This is a sampling flaw. Can we assume that the weather in George's area is a representative sample of global weather patterns?To analyze that argument core, we are asking ourselves, ""If I accept that the weather in George's area is weirdly warm, do I have to accept that global warming is already occurring?""(A) whether carbon dioxide is the only cause of global warming -- Incorrect --He never claimed to know what is causing global warming. He only claimed that global warming is happening.(B) when leaves on the trees in the town usually change color -- We believe George's premise, that the leaves were late in changing color. We don't need to question this.(C) what proportion of global emissions of carbon dioxide is due to the burning of trees by humans --We don't care exactly what proportion of CO2 emissions comes from burning trees. George's argument core has nothing to do with CO2 emissions or trees. That 1st sentence has nothing to do with George's argument core.(D) whether air pollution is causing some trees in the are to lose their leaves --This is temptingly close to an answer that would propose an alternative cause for why the leaves in George's area are late in turning color. However, this isn't about causing leaves to turn color more quickly or slowly. It's about leaves falling off. That's not relevant to George's evidence or his conclusion.(E) whether unusually warm weather is occurring elsewhere on the globe more frequently than before - Correct - If we say unusually warm weather IS happening globally more frequently than before, then we strengthen George's argument that global warming is currently happening.If we say unusually warm weather IS NOT happening globally more frequently than before, then we weaken George's argument that global warming is currently happening.Answer E noboruGeorge: Some scientists say that global warming will occur because people are releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning trees and fossil fuels.

The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages. As Bell’s president is well aware, however, in order to increase the worker’s wages, Bell would have to sell off some of its subsidiaries. So, some of Bell’s subsidiaries will be sold.Conclusion: Bell will sell subsidiariesPremise: Workers going on strike unless management ups wages, but subsidiaries need to be sold to up wagesAssumption: Bell cares is workers go on strikeThe conclusion above is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?(A) Bell Manufacturing will begin to suffer increased losses.PROBLEM: We don't need this to make the argument work, because this is theoretical about the strike, not necessarily implying that the strike will happen. If it doesn't, there needn't be any losses.(B) Bell’s management will refuse to increase its worker’s wages.PROBLEM: This is the opposite of what we want. If they don't increase wages, they won't need to sell subsidiaries.(C) The workers at Bell Manufacturing will not be going on strike.ANSWER: Try ""least extreme negation"" (this is the method whereby you can take the opposite of every answer choice, and whichever one DESTROYS the argument is the correct assumption). ""The workers WILL be going on strike."" If they go on strike, then that means their wages weren't increased, and thus that the company didn't sell its subsidiaries. That would destroy the conclusion.(D) Bell’s president has the authority to offer the workers their desired wage increase.PROBLEM: We don't need the president to have the authority. The board could do it, or anybody.(E) Bell’s workers will not accept a package of improved benefits in place of their desired wage increase.PROBLEM: Totally irrelevant, as the argument is ABOUT the wage increase.Hope that helps!-t gmatcracker2010The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages. As Bell’s president is well aware, however, in order to increase the worker’s wages, Bell would have to sell off some of its subsidiaries. So, some of Bell’s subsidiaries will be sold.The conclusion above is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?(A) Bell Manufacturing will begin to suffer increased losses.(B) Bell’s management will refuse to increase its worker’s wages.(C) The workers at Bell Manufacturing will not be going on strike.(D) Bell’s president has the authority to offer the workers their desired wage increase.(E) Bell’s workers will not accept a package of improved benefits in place of their desired wage increase.Workers will go on strike if management doesn't increase wages.To increase wages Bell needs to sell subsidiaries. Subsidiaries will be sold if we assume that:Management will increase wages. Then workers will not go on strike.We should find one of these assumptions in the answer choices:A. Not inferred from the passage, because Bell could sell subsidiaries and not suffer losses.B. Then Bell's subsidiaries don't need to be sold and workers will go on strike. Since the conclusion is that subsidiaries will be sold, one of the assumptions is that the management will increase wages, opposite to this option.C. If we assume that the workers will not go on strike, is because the management increased the wages, and will sell some subsidiaries. This is properly drawn with the conclusion of the argument.D. It's not relevant. He can offer, he can also sell subsidiaries. But this assumption doesn't help us here.E. If they will not accept a package, it means that the management decided not to increase the wages and decided not to sell some subsidiaries. It goes against the conclusion.According to this reasoning, C is the best option. Nice Question gmatcracker2010.  IMO C and OA is C too.The question asks to identify the assumption made for concluding that the subsidiaries will be sold. If some of the subsidiaries are sold, then the increase in wages is certain. Increase in wages will in turn imply that the workers will not go on a strike.You can also insert all the assumption choices in the argument and boil down to the one that makes sense logically.  I have inserted option C to show that it makes sense.The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages. As Bell’s president is well aware, however, in order to increase the worker’s wages, Bell would have to sell off some of its subsidiaries.Since, the workers at Bell Manufacturing will not be going on strike, some of Bell’s subsidiaries will be sold.(A) Bell Manufacturing will begin to suffer increased losses.(B) Bell’s management will refuse to increase its worker’s wages.(C) The workers at Bell Manufacturing will not be going on strike.(D) Bell’s president has the authority to offer the workers their desired wage increase.(E) Bell’s workers will not accept a package of improved benefits in place of their desired wage increase. The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages. As Bell’s president is well aware, however, in order to increase the worker’s wages, Bell would have to sell off some of its subsidiaries.

What if the president doesn't care whether the workers go on strike?

This statement describes a NECESSARY condition. In order to avoid a strike, management MUST increase wages. Since we are given this fact, we have to assume that no other solution will prevent the strike.Choice (E) simply restates something that is already implied by this premise. The author does not have to make this assumption since we are already given the fact that only a wage increase will prevent a strike.I hope this helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More gmatcracker2010The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages.

Let me know whether I am correct or not? KarishmaB- Hi Karishma, this is to better understand the necessary/sufficient condition here-In the above question, if the management increases the wages, then there is still a possibility that the workers may / may not go on a strike. But if the management doesn't increase the wages, then 100% the workers will go on the strike right? Is my understanding correct ? Can you share more color on necessary/sufficient condition in this example.I see a conflict in the approach to the above and the below question:https://gmatclub.com/forum/unless-negot ... s#p3252226There we said that if negotiations begin soon, then cease fire may or may not be violatedSimilarly then in the above question, how can we say that if management increases the wages, the workers will not go on strike? They may because the management increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. gmatcracker2010The workers at Bell Manufacturing will shortly go on strike unless the management increases their wages.

So 'wage increase' is NECESSARY for 'NOT going on strike.'Then here are the premises:'Wage increase' is NECESSARY for 'NOT going on strike.'Selling subsidiaries is necessary in order to increase  wages.Conclusion: Some of Bell’s subsidiaries will be sold.To conclude that some subsidiaries will be sold, we are assuming that workers will not go on strike. For not going on strike, it is necessary that wage will increase. For wage increase, it is necessary to sell subsidiaries.and hence we are concluding that subsidiaries will be sold. Makes sense. We are ""properly drawing"" the conclusion.

They may because the management increase is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.As for the link of the other question you mentioned, note that the question stems are different.In our current question we  need toproperly draw the conclusioni.e.  the conclusion must follow from the premises and the assumption together. So to be sure that some subsidies will be sold, we need to say that strike will not happen because wage increase is necessary for strike not happening and selling subsidies is necessary for wage increase.Then, if we know that strike did not happen, we know for sure that wage increase must have happened and subsidies must have been sold. Our conclusion follows.In the other question, we are asked what must be true and what is not necessary to be true.We are given that negotiations did begin soon (the necessary condition is true). Does this mean that the cease fire will not be violated? No. Negotiations are necessary, not sufficient for cease fire to not be violated._________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More CrismoreGMATNinjaRidhimajain96I choose Ebecause if workers will accept a package of improved benefits in place of their desired wage increase then there will be no need to sell subsidiaries.

The author does not have to make this assumption since we are already given the fact that only a wage increase will prevent a strike.I hope this helps!GMATNinjaI think in the highlighted part you meant that the statement described is a SUFFICIENT condition, since a sufficient condition leaves no room for assuming other possibilities, but a necessary condition actually does it. Let me know whether I am correct or not?Sorry that I'm late to the party here! You raise a great question -- what's the difference between a necessary condition and a sufficient one?Well, a sufficient condition allows a conclusion to be drawn. For example, if my friend Albert lives in Iceland, is that SUFFICIENT to conclude that he lives on earth? Yes, it is. However, it isn't necessary. To live on earth, it isn't absolutely NECESSARY that you live in Iceland.Let's take that the other way. If my friend lives in Iceland, then living on earth is a NECESSARY condition for that to be true. But it isn't SUFFICIENT. In other words, just because Albert lives on earth doesn't mean he lives in Iceland.Let's apply that logic to answer choice (E):Quote:Bell’s workers will not accept a package of improved benefits in place of their desired wage increase.Notice this isn't SUFFICIENT to reach the conclusion. Just because workers ""will not accept a package of improved benefits in place of a wage increase"" doesn't mean some of Bell's subsidiaries will be sold. Even if the workers don't accept the package, we don'thaveto conclude that some of Bell's subsidiaries will be sold.Put another way -- even if (E) is true, other outcomes besides Bell selling subsidiaries are possible. Maybe the president will simply allow the workers to go on strike, in which case Bell wouldn't have to raise wages or sell subsidiaries?Bottom line, since (E) doesn't guarantee the conclusion, it isn't sufficient.However, (E)isnecessary. We need to assume that Bell's workers will NOT accept the package. Because if they did, the strike could be avoided without raising wages or selling subsidiaries. Since we're looking for a SUFFICIENT condition, however, not a NECESSARY one, (E) is incorrect.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More not an 800+ question honestly.

"In 1990 major engine repairs were performed on 10 percent of the cars that had been built by the National Motor Company in the 1970s and that were still registered.

The unusual thing in the situation described is that a smaller percentage of the older cars had engine work done. One might think that a greater percentage of older cars would need repairs, but notice that the stimulus refers to which automobiles had repairs, not which needed them. If the cars from the 1960s are probably in more need of repair, why have a greater percentage of 1970s cars received repairs? Maybe you tried to pre-phrase an answer. We’re dealing with percentages again, not raw numbers, so fewer older cars on the road wouldn’t make for a good answer. Maybe you considered the economics associated with repairs: If a car is worth $500, and engine repairs cost $1000, it probably doesn’t make much financial sense to get the car repaired. This is the idea that gets the point: If older cars are not worth the expense, and are scrapped instead of repaired, then the statistics described in the stimulus are understandable. (C) nicely clears up thediscrepancy.(A) Inspection for emission levels probably would turn up more problems in older cars, which suggests that the older cars would have a greater percentage of repairs, so (A) only deepens the mystery.(B) New cars are out of the scope based on the dates provided in the passage. Even if we considered the 1970s cars “new” (at least, newer than cars from the 1960s), this choice would, like choice (A), make the facts even less understandable.(D) Whether or not simplified car engines result in fewer repairs is pretty shaky, but even if they did, (D) would also suggest that the sixties models would need more repairs.(E) chastises those negligent 60’s car owners for not maintaining their cars, but it doesn’t mention 1970s cars, and thus does nothing to explain the discrepancy.• When attempting to resolve a discrepancy, be wary of choices that further confound the odd result or finding found in the stimulus.• When the discrepancy revolves around two groups or things (which is usually the case), quickly eliminate any choice that offers information on only one of them, like (E) here. A true resolution to such a discrepancy must be based on a fact that in some way relates to both groups. broallIn 1990 major engine repairs were performed on 10 percent of the cars that had been built by the National Motor Company in the 1970s and that were still registered.

Well if older cars are more likely to be discarded, then if someone has a car that needs engine work, their chances of tossing it rather than fixing it are greater, if it's a car from the 1960's. I guess it's related to the notation that at some point it's just not worth it to keep spending money to fix these cars. broallIn 1990 major engine repairs were performed on 10 percent of the cars that had been built by the National Motor Company in the 1970s and that were still registered.

Among 100% manufactured cars in 1960's, let's say 80% of them were already discarded. On the other hand, all 100% cars form 1970's still available on the road.(D) The cars that the National Motor Company built in the 1970s incorporated simplified engine designs that made the engines less complicated than those of earlier models.Does simply design affect the durability of the major engine? Nop.(E) Many of the repairs that were performed on the cars that the National Motor Company built in the 1960s could have been avoided if periodic routine maintenance had been performed.Irrelevant.Wdyt?_________________There's an app for that - Steve Jobs.Signature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

It's not that the negation of the correct answer will destroy the conclusion, but that it makes it so the conclusion does not follow from the evidence offered. So after negating answer choice (E), the conclusion that lobsters do not eat one another in response to hunger may still be true, but we would not be able to use the evidence provided to support such a conclusion. An assumption of this argument is that the lobsters were in fact hungry. Without that assumption the example of the lobsters would be irrelevant to a claim about what happens to lobsters in response to hunger. Answer choice (E) simply provides this assumption.Let's take a look at the incorrect answer choices:(A) undermines the argument that lobsters will not each other in response to hunger.(B) is irrelevant. Two months is more than enough time to allow a lobster to become hungry, and if it wasn't, that would again simply undermine the argument.(C) is irrelevant. The frequency with which lobsters are caught in large groups plays no role in what happens once they are.(D) is tempting in that it suggests the behavior is common at least on other marine species, but while it helps, it is not a Necessary Assumption of the argument. broallMarine biologists had hypothesized that lobsters kept together in lobster traps eat one another in response to hunger. Periodic checking of lobster traps, however, has revealed instances of lobsters sharing traps together for weeks. Eight lobsters even shared one trap together for two months without eating one another. The marine biologists’ hypothesis, therefore, is clearly wrong.The argument against the marine biologists’ hypothesis is based on which one of the following assumptions?(A) Lobsters not caught in lobster traps have been observed eating one another.(B) Two months is the longest known period during which eight or more lobsters have been trapped together.(C) It is unusual to find as many as eight lobsters caught together in one single trap.(D) Members of other marine species sometimes eat their own kind when no other food sources are available.(E) Any food that the eight lobsters in the trap might have obtained was not enough to ward off hunger.Source: LSATI will go with option E.Any food that the eight lobsters in the trap might have obtained was not enough to ward off hunger.Negate that:Any food that the eight lobsters in the trap might have obtained WAS enough to ward off hunger.When you negate that answer choice and have it say that the lobsters might have obtained food that was enough to keep away hunger.

Based on this author claims that marine biologist's claim is wrong. Thus, author thinks that lobsters were hungry in that trap for two months. If they were not hungry the argument dies here itself. So, they must be hungry to prove the point otherwise(as per author). And how this is possible, by lobsters remaining hungry in that trap. Then how they remain hungry, by eating whatever they had in that trap which eventually didn't end their hunger. This happened only when the food they got was not enough.E gives us this ans is the right answer._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

There may be many more street criminals than embezzlers.(D) Yes.The underlying premise of the argument is that the percentage of people in either group who are actually guilty is the same. Perhaps nearly all the people who rely on court-appointed public defenders are actually guilty, but few of the people who hire private lawyers are actually guilty.(E) No. The passage argues that the lesser quality of public defenders causes the higher conviction rate of their clients.

If both street criminals and criminals who commit lucrative crimes can afford expensive lawyers then we cannot conclusively say that expensive private defense lawyers are the primary cause of lower conviction among criminals who commit lucrative crimes.Option B gives another reason for higher conviction rate among street criminals. Again, this choice weakens the argument that expensive private defense lawyers are the primary cause of lower conviction among criminals who commit lucrative crimes.Option C talks about the number of criminals convicted.

The observed phenomenon is the lower conviction rate for people accused of committing lucrative crimes.This question asks us to strengthen the argument, so we're seeking an answer choice that eliminates a competing explanation.(A) is irrelevant because it doesn't tell us about why people are not getting convicted.(B) weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation. It's not the expensive private defense attorney, but rather the incompetent prosecutor.(C) is irrelevant.

It should mean that the conviction rate is same for both types of defences, thereby weakening the argument.Hi,Option D says even though the actual rate of crime committed by publicly defended is ""equal to or less than"" that by the privately defended, the conviction rate is higher for the former. That means private lawyers are more successful in saving their defendants from being convicted. Hence, it strengthens the argument. the explanation use statistical data in its argument so we need to find an answer that is related to statistical data too. Only D fits this requirement. According to the premise, the percentage of conviction of high class crimes is much lower than that of street criminals. The induction from the statistical data in the premise is much stronger now to arrive at the conclusion when we know that the percentage of actual commitment of crime is the same between high class crime and street criminals I missed this one. Isn't 'make more persuasive' a strengthening question? I chose B because it gives us another reason to believe the conclusion.

While the argument claims that the reduced speed limit saved lives, this answer-choice indicates an alternative possibility and therefore weakens the argument.(B) No. This does not explain why traffic fatalities decreased during the first eleven years following the speed limit reduction.(C) No. This would weaken the argument because the safety equipment, not the reduced speed limit, might be responsible for the decreased rate of fatalities.(D) Yes.This strongly indicates that the decrease in speed reduced the chance of fatal injuries during automobile accidents. A lower speed limit (presuming some people obey it) should therefore reduce the rate of highway fatalities.(E) No. This suggests that accidents can be avoided by matching speeds with surrounding traffic—regardless of what the speed is. In this case, a lower speed limit should not affect the number of accidents. Note, although this implies the probability of an accident shouldn’t be affected by the speed, conceivably the chance of fatalities if an accident does occur might be affected by the speed.

Just because the percentages went down, it doesn't mean more lives were saved. It could be that the drop in the speed limit led to many more people driving, so even though we had a drop in the rate of fatalities, more people were dying each year.2. Author mistakes correlation for causation.Just because the drop in speed limit coincided with the drop in the rate of fatalities, it doesn't mean the two are related. It could be that something else, such as a national campaign to promote better driving, was the cause.To strengthen the first issue, we have to show that the number of people driving did not increase to such an extent whereby we could not conclude that many lives were saved.To strengthen the second issue, we have to rule out the possibility that some other factor caused the drop. It's important to note that when we are given correlation/causation flaws on Strengthen and Weaken questions, the answer choice usually tests our understanding of this. So it is likely that we will be tested on the second issue.A. this was very tempting for me at first because it seems to get at our first issue. That there was no increase in driving. However, if that's that case, it would provide an alternative cause for the drop in fatalities, so it can't be correct.B. is irrelevant because we don't know anything about the 12th year. Maybe the speed limit was increased again.C. gives us an alternative cause, which means it would weaken the argument.D. gives us a classic way to strengthen a correlation flaw on the LSAT - by showing that when you don't have the cause, you won't get the effect.55mph --> lower rateD: don't have 55mph --> rate is not as highThis strengthens our correlation and is the correct answer.E. not impact on argument. broallIn 1974 the speed limit on highways in the United States was reduced to 55 miles per hour in order to save fuel.

Eliminate on a solid ground.(D) The fatality rate in highway accidents involving motorists driving faster than 55 miles per hour is much higher than inhighway accidents that do not involve motorists driving at such speeds.BINGO! strengthen the premise or CAUSE that states that >55 means more fatal accidents.(E) Motorists are more likely to avoid accidents by matching their speed to that of the surrounding highway traffic than by driving at faster or slower speeds.Doesn't talk about fatality._________________There's an app for that - Steve Jobs.Signature Read More Quote:Conclusion: the drop in the speed limit saved many livesWHY: the speed limit was reduced to 55, and after one year the rate of highway fatalities dropped by 15 %, and over the next ten years it dropped another 25 percent.Looking at this core, I noticed two problems:1. the author seems to be playing with percentages. Just because the percentages went down, it doesn't mean more lives were saved. It could be that the drop in the speed limit led to many more people driving, so even though we had a drop in the rate of fatalities, more people were dying each year.2. Author mistakes correlation for causation.Just because the drop in speed limit coincided with the drop in the rate of fatalities, it doesn't mean the two are related. It could be that something else, such as a national campaign to promote better driving, was the cause.To strengthen the first issue, we have to show that the number of people driving did not increase to such an extent whereby we could not conclude that many lives were saved.To strengthen the second issue, we have to rule out the possibility that some other factor caused the drop. It's important to note that when we are given correlation/causation flaws on Strengthen and Weaken questions, the answer choice usually tests our understanding of this. So it is likely that we will be tested on the second issue.A. this was very tempting for me at first because it seems to get at our first issue. That there was no increase in driving. However, if that's that case, it would provide an alternative cause for the drop in fatalities, so it can't be correct.B. is irrelevant because we don't know anything about the 12th year. Maybe the speed limit was increased again.C. gives us an alternative cause, which means it would weaken the argument.D. gives us a classic way to strengthen a correlation flaw on the LSAT - by showing that when you don't have the cause, you won't get the effect.55mph --> lower rateD: don't have 55mph --> rate is not as highThis strengthens our correlation and is the correct answer.E. not impact on argument.Skywalker18Hello!I just want to say this: the detail with which you provide explanations across the forum is just extraordinary. Be it CR,RC or SC.  Way too good.Thank you! In 1974 the speed limit on highways in the United States was reduced to 55 miles per hour in order to save fuel. In the first 12 months after the change, the rate of highway fatalities dropped 15 percent, the sharpest one-year drop in history. Over the next 10 years, the fatality rate declined by another 25 percent. It follows that the 1974 reduction in the speed limit saved many lives.Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?(A) The 1974fuel shortage cut driving sharplyfor more than a year. - WRONG. Weakener. Alternative reason behind such a drop.(B) There wasno decline in the rate of highway fatalities during the twelfth yearfollowing the reduction in the speed limit. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(C) Since 1974 automobile manufacturers have been required by law toinstall lifesaving equipment, such as seat belts, in all new cars. - Weakener. Alternative reason behind such a drop.(D) The fatality rate in highway accidents involving motorists driving faster than 55 miles per hour is much higher than in highway accidents that do not involve motorists driving at such speeds. - CORRECT. As easy as it can get.(E) Motorists are more likely toavoid accidents by matching their speed to that of the surrounding highway trafficthan by driving at faster or slower speeds. - WRONG. Weakener. Alternative reason behind such a drop.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More E is trap answer....I believe understanding the trap answers are equally importantPosted from my mobile device Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Although an inexpensive method of reducing temperature fluctuations in a freezer would solve the problem of poor ice cream consistency, the passage says nothing about the actual cost of developing a device to achieve this.(D) No. The stabilizers are used to stabilize the consistency of ice cream at higher temperatures, so apparently they function well enough at those temperatures.(E) Yes.The passage states that the “consistency of ice cream is adversely affected by even slight temperature changes,” so the best consistency will occur with stable temperatures. Further, the passage states “stabilizers, though inexpensive, adversely affect flavor” and “stabilizers are less needed if storage temperatures are very low.” So the best flavor will occur at very low stable temperatures._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More lavanyak92The consistency of ice cream is adversely affected by even slight temperature changes in the freezer.

Eliminate! We have no evidence regarding the relationship between consistency and flavor. They are treated as separate in the evidence we have.(B) tempting answer. However, if anything, the evidence seems to point to the opposite. High temps are cheaper, and at high temps, stabilizers are more necessary. And stabilizers are inexpensive. And they preserve consistency and impair flavor.(C) way off. This may or may not be true. No evidence of any kind is presented regarding new devices and their potential cost-effectiveness.(D) way off. In fact, the opposite seems to be true. Stabilizers are less needed at low temps.(E) For good consistency, we need a stable temp (no changes). For good flavor, we don't want stabilizers, which means we want ""very low"" temps.

If the ice creams are stored at high temperatures, we will need to add stabilizers because ""Stabilizers are less needed if storage temperatures are very low"". Adding stabilizers solves the problem of inconsistency as mentioned in Line 1. However, if you add stabilizers, the flavor is adversely affected as mentioned in Line 2.Hence, Cost considerations favor sacrificing flavor over consistency.Option B furtively switches these terms and hence is incorrect !! Good one.It's a close one between B and E.In my opinion B is not necessarily correct, because it's not just the consistency that is sacrificed but also the flavor. Why ? Simple. High temp(decrease consistency-->this is the PROBLEM)   --->  Use of stabilizers to overcome that PROBLEM ----> The use adversely affects flavor(as stated in the passage). Hence both are necessarily sacrificed in the process of cost considerations.Given the facts of this passage, E must hold true.[Stabilizers are needed to overcome the problem of decrease in ice cream consistency. Therefore if low temperatures require less stabilizers it simply implies that at low temperatures consistency is hardly affected and therefore is at it's best possible state. Moreover the use of less stabilizers also preserves the original flavor of the ice cream) Quote:However, since energy costs are constantly going up, those costs constitute a strong incentive in favor of relatively high storage temperatures.Can anyone please help me clarify this sentence. I don't understand the meaning.and what's role of this in the argument as a whole?as I understand because the cost is going up so despite the fact that Stabilizers are expensive, they still use them anyway => Therefore I chose B. lichtingQuote:However, since energy costs are constantly going up, those costs constitute a strong incentive in favor of relatively high storage temperatures.Can anyone please help me clarify this sentence.

Great! So as long as we have very low storage temperatures, we can have the consistency we want without affecting the flavor!But it's not that simple: ""since energy costs are constantly going up, {energy} costs constitute a strong incentive in favor of relatively high storage temperatures.""In other words,Storing ice cream at very low temperatures might be great for the consistency and the flavor, but it's expensive.Because of expensive energy costs, there's an incentive to store ice cream at relatively high temperatures.By using relatively high storage temperatures, we'll save money on energy costs, but now we have to face the consistency problem.We know that energy cost considerations favor higher storage temperatures. With high storage temperatures, we have to chose between consistency issues (without stabilizers) or flavor issues (with stabilizers). So we have to sacrifice either flavor or consistency.In that case, will manufacturers favor consistency or flavor? We can't tell based on the information in the passage, so (B) cannot properly be inferred.I hope that helps!

If the National Health scheme cuts costs for private insurers, then their rates should decrease.(B) No. This strengthens the paradox. If 80 percent of medical costs are now covered by the National Health scheme, then the private insurance rates should decrease.(C) No. This is irrelevant.(D) Yes.If people buy private insurance only when they expect to need it for unusual medical procedures not covered by the National Health scheme, then presumably fewer people have private health insurance than before the National Health scheme. Furthermore, a greater percentage of those with insurance will have claims (since people expect to require these procedures, perhaps because of a family history or because of the existence of early symptoms). Thus, the costs will be spread over a smaller pool of people while the costs themselves may not decrease as much.

This doesn't solve the paradox.(B) Before the National Health scheme was introduced, more than 80 percent of all Impanian medical costs were associated with procedures that are now covered by the scheme.>>> Again if major chunks of isurances/claims are handled by NHI, cost of private health insurance should go down.(C) Impanians who previously were unable to afford regular medical treatment now use the National Health scheme, but the number of Impanians with private health insurance has not increased.>>> IMO, Correct >>> If the number of cases handled by private health insurers remain same...then cost of private health insurance might not go down...!!(D) Impanians now buy private medical insurance only at times when they expect that they will need care of kinds not available in the National Health scheme.>>> Refer to explanation for option B.(E) The proportion of total expenditures within Impania that is spent on health care has declined since the introduction of the National Health scheme.>>> IMO, the cost of private health insurance should also go down.Argument Simplified :Before National Health Insurance (NHI), cost of private health insurance was high.Now after NHI, the cost of private health insurance should go down(Reason given : private insurance companies have to pay only for the more unusual and sophisticated medical procedures).BUT, the cost of private health insurance is still high.Wats the OA. D, all the way:noboruSince the introduction of the Impanian National Health Scheme, Impanians (or their private insurance companies) have had to pay only for the more unusual and sophisticated medical procedures. When the scheme was introduced, it was hoped that private insurance to pay for these procedures would be available at modest cost, since the insurers would no longer be paying for the bulk of health care costs, as they had done previously. Paradoxically, however, the cost of private health insurance did not decrease but has instead increased dramatically in the years since the scheme’s introduction.Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the apparently paradoxical outcome?(A) The National Health scheme has greatly reduced the number of medical claims handled annually by Impania’s private insurers, enabling these firms to reduce overhead costs substantially.Usually if you reduce overhead you're going to either lower prices or enjoy a wider margin. Price hikes are better associated with overhead cost increases. So this runs counter to the paradox.(B) Before the National Health scheme was introduced, more than 80 percent of all Impanian medical costs were associated with procedures that are now covered by the scheme.This seems only to restate what we already know... it does give us a better number but doesn't help explain the paradox.(C) Impanians who previously were unable to afford regular medical treatment now use the National Health scheme, but the number of Impanians with private health insurance has not increased.This doesn't make the case as to why private cost has gone up... if they kept their same customer base then why the need to hike prices, dramatically or otherwise?(D) Impanians now buy private medical insurance only at times when they expect that they will need care of kinds not available in the National Health scheme.This puts forth a supply and demand theory that we should all be familiar with. Demand for private health care dropped drastically... in order to compensate, private firms jacked up their prices... especially now that the likelihood of someone making a claim is naturally higher! This answer gives us two reasons why the situation occurred. I like it.(E) The proportion of total expenditures within Impania that is spent on health care has declined since the introduction of the National Health scheme.Clearly out of scope! can someone explain the option (D) in more simple terms. seekmbacan someone explain the option (D) in more simple terms.Insurance makes it money by assuming that of the X amount of people that buy its service, only a small % will actually make a claim and cost the firm money.In D)s case, it's stated that it's much more likely that people would buy the private insurance ""only at times when they expect that they will need care of kinds not available in the National Health scheme.""Essentially, this mens the previously small % I spoke of earlier is going to way up. In order remain profitable, the insurer needs to increase price to compensate for the increased risk inherent with each new customer.To illustrate with oversimplified numbers, say your insurance costs $10. If you make a valid claim you get $10,000This is good for the insurer if they have a million customers each carrying a 0.01% risk of claiming because they dish out $1,000,000 in claims and take in $10,000,000.But if that risk goes up to say, 2% ... That's 20,000 claimants which cost the company... erk, $200,000,000. How does the company not go bankrupt in three seconds? The raise the cost until their margins are met. Going from .01% to 2% is like a 200x increase in risk, so that $10 you were paying before is going to turn into $2000 to get things back to the way they used to be. oh, wow, tough one. took some time to answer it. D is the clear winner. Looks like a ""solve the paradox"" kind of question.it was expected the costs of private insurance to decrease, but in reality, it increased.the only explanation that could be is that clients buy private insurance only when they actually need special kind of procedures not covered by the regular one. D says exactly this. Since the introduction of the Impanian National Health Scheme, Impanians (or their private insurance companies) have had to pay only for the more unusual and sophisticated medical procedures. When the scheme was introduced, it was hoped that private insurance to pay for these procedures would be available at modest cost, since the insurers would no longer be paying for the bulk of health care costs, as they had done previously. Paradoxically, however, the cost of private health insurance did not decrease but has instead increased dramatically in the years since the scheme’s introduction.Boil it down-The paradox is that now insurance companies don't have to pay for as many things as before, so they should in theory make their rates cheaper. But the opposite happens - even though they now pay for less, their rates have gone up!Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the apparently paradoxical outcome?(A) The National Health scheme has greatly reduced the number of medical claims handled annually by Impania’s private insurers, enabling these firms to reduce overhead costs substantially.-- deepens paradox(B) Before the National Health scheme was introduced, more than 80 percent of all Impanian medical costs were associated with procedures that are now covered by the scheme. -- deepens paradox(C) Impanians who previously were unable to afford regular medical treatment now use the National Health scheme, but the number of Impanians with private health insurance has not increased. --doesn't seem too relevant. We don't care whether the number of people with private insurance has gone up or down. That doesn't (unless you bring in outside knowledge) explain why the price would change, so this is not the answer.(D) Impanians now buy private medical insurance only at times when they expect that they will need care of kinds not available in the National Health scheme. --Now that normal people don't need private insurance for normal/average medical stuff, it's really only sick people or special people who need this special insurance. Therefore, all the ordinary people are going to drop out, and only people who need the procedures are going to get the insurance. So the insurance company may be paying out more relative to what it's taking in, since all the healthy people have gone to the National Health Plan.(E) The proportion of total expenditures within Impania that is spent on health care has declined since the introduction of the National Health scheme. --doesn't go either way - we care about the insurance companies in particular, not about the general spending patterns in this mythical country.Answer D Although this question is a LSAT question, and the argument structure is quite complex, the question does sound like a gmat-like question.Using POE, test takers can cross out A,B, and E.C does not concern with why private insurances charge higher premiums. Took me a while to see this. D) points out that the premiums for health insurance have gone up because the insurance companie's revenue has declined (people only buy insurance when needed). I just did this LSAT, got 22/25 right and finished in less than 58 min. But, I got this qn wrong and I think this is the best question of the entire set.You need to have very basic understanding of how insurance works. This is general knowledge in majority of the countries but not all. So, some folks miss it because they don't understand insurance as it is not common.

Sugar dehydrates the wounds therefore eliminating the moist environment that bacteria thrive in.(B) Sugar that is nearly pure is readily available for use in medical treatments.Although this may explain why physicians use sugar, it does not explain why it is effective in eliminating bacteria.(C) Many kinds of bacteria can use sugar as a nutrient and will reproduce rapidly when sugar is available to them.This actually negates the conclusion.

ExplanationIt’s tough to pre-phrase an answer to this one; you simply need to attack the choices in search of an explanation as to why packing a wound with sugar would so successfully kill those hardy and ubiquitous bacteria. And you needn’t search long: If sugar makes a wound dry and if bacteria like moisture, as(A)states, then it’s not surprising that a sugar environment tends to spell R.I.P. for bacteria.(B)So sugar is available for use.

So, we're looking for an answer that is required to be true, in order for the conclusion to have a chance of being true.The conclusion of the argument is that one can tell how quickly a new idea is taking hold by by monitoring how how fast the word is passing into common usage. The problem with this is that the idea may no longer be represented in the word by the time it becomes common. The meaning of the word could have shifted and so the idea is not taking hold in society, even though the word is. This is best expressed in answer choice (D). Negating answer choice (D) would say, ""As the word passes into common usage, it's meaning does undergo severe distortions in the process."" The meaning of the word would no longer be the same, so tracking the word, would not be tracking the idea.(A) is not necessary. They could be interested in words that are rarely used, but that doesn't mean that the editors would in their professional opinions claim that the words had passed into common usage.(B) is not necessary. How the editors determine whether the word has passed into common usage is not important.(C) is backwards. it's not that the editors must include the word in their dictionaries for the word to take hold, but that once it takes hold, it gets included in the dictionary.(D) is necessary to for using the common usage of a word to determine whether a new idea is taking hold in society.(E) would tend to weaken the argument, so is not necessary to it. If the words are being used before the meaning is understood, then tracking the word tells us nothing of whether the idea is taking hold. People would be using the word without an understanding of its meaning. broallOne sure way you can tell how quickly a new idea—for example, the idea of “privatization”—is taking hold among the population is to monitor how fast the word or words expressing that particular idea are passing into common usage.

To determine how quickly words enter into common use, dictionary editors should have a professional interest and awareness of words that have not yet reached popular usage.(B) No. The passage refers to “professional opinions,” not to any exact criteria.(C) No. The passage is arguing that dictionaries are a means of measuring how quickly a new idea is accepted, not the arbiters of whether a new idea will be accepted.(D) Yes.If the meaning of a word has changed to the point that it no longer stands for the concept it originally stood for, then the fact that it is in common use does not mean that the original concept is in common use. For example, the word “bad” when used as slang can mean “good.”(E) No. This would weaken the argument. If a word denoting a new idea is commonly used but typically not understood, then the word’s popularity will falsely indicate how quickly the idea it denotes is taking hold._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More One sure way you can tell how quickly a new idea—for example, the idea of “privatization”—is taking hold among the population is to monitor how fast the word or words expressing that particular idea are passing into common usage.

Now, we need to fill the gap by finding correct information that helps us to derive the conclusion stated.(A) Dictionary editors are not professionally interested in words that are only rarely used.<==Keep thisas it talks about things in conclusion - Dictionary editors, their professional interests and usage of words.(B) Dictionary editors have exact numerical criteria for telling when a word has passed into common usage.<== Numerical data...?Really..? clearly out of scope.Eliminate(C) For a new idea to take hold, dictionary editors have to include the relevant word or words in their dictionaries.<== Its reversing the phenomenon by saying first editors include relevant word or words and then idea is passed. Then this means its true for all the words that exist and it becomes extreme.Eliminate(D) As a word passes into common usages, its meaning does not undergo any severe distortions in the process.<== I found this difficult to comprehend and hence NOT sure if this can be eliminated. This has something related to premise; words, their common usages, changes to meaning (implying dictionary editors need to be pulled in).Keep it.(E) Words denoting new ideas tend to be used before the ideas denoted are understood.<== really...? People start using words without understanding meaning implies idea is NOT taking hold despite words going in common usage. This is not stated in premise(s)EliminateOkay, Now with process of elimination we have narrowed down the answer choices to 'A' and 'D'. Now, Let's Check/Analyze further.(A) Dictionary editors arenotprofessionally interested in words that areonlyrarely used.<== Although, it talks about things in conclusion - Dictionary editors, their professional interests and usage of words.Premise talks about (can be inferred that) 'Dictionary editors are professionally interested in words that go into common usages'.That is answer choice is saying something - which may be true, may NOT true - that Premise doesn't talk anything about.Its like premise says, IF 'X', THEN 'Y'. However, this answer choice says, If NOT X, THEN NOT 'Y'.Eliminate... Eliminate...[/color]Now, we are left with one option - option 'D'.And that's our final answer.(D) As a word passes into common usages, its meaning does not undergo any severe distortions in the process.No matter how awkward/weird it looks to you, no matter how much you comprehend the remaining answer choice, that's going to be answer choice.(I took 2 minutes reading this option D again and again and click on 'D', which was waste of time) Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

As per the theory -  fear of retaliation makes a would-be aggressor nation hesitate before attacking2. Hence the nation that has to defense has to show the aggressor that its military power is greater than that of the aggressor(A) A would-be aggressor nation can be deterred from attackingonlyif it has certain knowledge that it would be destroyed in retaliation by the country it attacks.Only is a strong word here. There can be other reasons too for not attacking.INCORRECT(B) A nation will not attack another nation if it believes that its own retaliatory power surpasses that of the other nation.This is opposite of what is being talked about hereINCORRECT(C) One nation’s failing to attack anotherestablishesthat the nation that fails to attack believes that it could not withstand a retaliatory attack from the other nation.Again, there might be other reasons that he nation did not attack. Establishing a a fact is pin pointing to a reason. This is too strong a usage.INCORRECT(D) It is in the interests of a nation that seeks deterrence and has unsurpassed military power to let potential aggressors against it become aware of its power of retaliatory attack.CORRECT. This is what the argument is all about and resonates with our part 2.(E) Maintaining maximum deterrence from aggression by other nationsrequiresthat a nation maintain a retaliatory force greater than that of any other nation.Requires again is a strong word. The nation can just tell plain lies to showcase its military power. It just needs to how the aggressors that it has more military power.INCORRECTIn a CR questions, try to avoid strong words in the answer choices. Going through the answer choices, we can see that only option D is a mild statement. All other statements are quite aggressive stating that for somethging to happen somethin MUST be done. So, our first step would be to take up D and check whether it logically follows the argument. The argument says ""to maintain military deterrence, a nation would have to believed to have retaliatory power so great that a potential aggressor nation would have reason to think that it could not defend itself against such retaliation."". Option D clearly follows on from this statement.Kudos Please... If my post helped. (A) A would-be aggressor nation can be deterred from attacking only if it has certain knowledge that it would be destroyed in retaliation by the country it attacks:Incorrect. It might be true but not a necessary condition.(B) A nation will not attack another nation if it believes that its own retaliatory power surpasses that of the other nation:Incorrect. Opposite(C) One nation’s failing to attack another establishes that the nation that fails to attack believes that it could not withstand a retaliatory attack from the other nation:Incorrect. It might be true but not necessarily true.(D) It is in the interests of a nation that seeks deterrence and has unsurpassed military power to let potential aggressors against it become aware of its power of retaliatory attack:Correct.(E) Maintaining maximum deterrence from aggression by other nations requires that a nation maintain a retaliatory force greater than that of any other nation:Incorrect. Out of scope. This is NOT a GMAT Pill question, but a real LSAT question (However it appears in GMAT Pill)1) that fear of retaliation is often sufficient to deter would be aggressors.2) that in order to maintain military deterrence, a nation would have to be believed to have retaliatory power greater than a potential aggressor could defend.(A) implies that fear of retaliation is required when it uses the words ""only if."" But the first statement in the stimulus implies that it's ""often sufficient.""(B) has the relationship in the second statement backwards. If a nation believes that it's military power surpasses that of others, then it will not be prevented from retaliating - but it may still attack in the first place.(C) isn't true either. One nation's not attacking doesn't establish that they feared retaliation. Maybe they just got along with the other nation. The stimulus discusses one thing that would prevent a nation from attacking another nation. The stimulus does not discuss the only thing that would prevent one nation from attacking another nation.(D) must be true. If one nation has a stronger military than any other nation, and military deterrence is achieved by other nations perceiving themselves to be weaker, then the strongest nation should let every other nation know it's strength, so that those other nations will be deterred from attacking.(E) is not necessarily true. A weaker nation could trick others into thinking that it was stronger and thereby achieve deterrence._________________My Stuff:Four Years to 760|MBA Trends for Indian ApplicantsMy GMAT ResourcesV30-V40: How to do it!|GMATPrep SC|GMATPrep CR|GMATPrep RC|Critical Reasoning Megathread|CR: Numbers and Statistics|CR: Weaken|CR: Strengthen|CR: Assumption|SC: Modifier|SC: Meaning|SC: SV Agreement|RC: Primary Purpose|PS/DS: Numbers and Inequalities|PS/DS: Combinatorics and CoordinatesMy MBA ResourcesEverything about the MBA Application|Over-Represented MBA woes|Fit Vs Rankings|Low GPA: What you can do|Letter of Recommendation: The Guide|Indian B Schools accepting GMAT score|Why MBA?My ReviewsHow I got into five schools from zero - Applicant Lab ReviewVeritas Prep Live OnlineSignature Read More The theory of military deterrence was based on a simple psychological truth, that fear of retaliation makes a would-be aggressor nation hesitate before attacking and is often sufficient to deter it altogether from attacking.

This reverses the order of 1(makes sufficient statement a necessary one) and hence is incorrect..B)If power surpasses another nation ->deter from attacking. This changes the sufficient condition of (1). Nowhere is it mentioned that surpassing power is sufficient to deter an attack.C) This can be reduced to: Deter from attacking -> believes that it could not withstand a retaliation attack. This is nowhere stated in the stimulus. Even if we assume that 'believes that it could not withstand a retaliation attack' means fear of retaliation, it reverses statement (1). Either way, it's incorrect(D)Correct. In line with (1) and (2).  If aggressors are aware of the power -> it will help maintain military deterrence which is in interests of the country(E)This can be reduced to: Maintain maximum deterrence -> Maintain the strongest retaliation force. This is incorrect not only because it 'exaggerates' the conditional statement (2), but also reverses it.

Focus on the underlined sentence - "" that might have such accidents will now install"". Here the author assumes that such accidents in present would motivate the company to install safeguards. But if a company say underestimates such future accidents?? If it assumes that such accidents happen once in say 10 years, then it might consider not installing the safeguards. Thus, this option definitely weakens the argument!](B) Businesses are as concerned with long-term as they are with short-term strategies for maximizing profits.[This is irrelevant, we are not bothered with long-term and short-term strategies, we just need to prove that the company won't install the safeguards, as its profit might not be affected](C) Businesses generally do the environmentally ""right"" thing only if doing so makes good business sense.[This option kind of strengthens it and makes us believe that the company might install the safeguards - eliminated](D) Businesses treat fines that are levied against them as an ordinary business expense.[Now this is what I had marked! This is incorrect. The company cares for its profit. Now if it considers it as an ordinary business expense, then that means, it would have to reduce this amount from the revenue that it is generating and that might lead to the decrease in its overall profit! If it reduces the profit, which the company cares so much about, then it would definitely install the safeguards to reduce such reductions in profit. So this option kind of strengthens the argument.](E) Businesses are leaning to exploit the public's environmental awareness in promoting themselves.[this is irrelevant and doesn't help us weakening the argument.] I answered DReanalyzed in my head afterwards, realized that the answer should be A, and it is simple, really.A companycan[and may bewill] ""install adequate environmental safeguards"" only if it canestimate correctly.If itunderestimates[in other wordsestimates wrong, either willfully or unwillingly] it simplycannotinstall adequate environmentall safeguards.I channelled my thought with the notion that the companyrefusesto install adequate environmental safeguards, what if itcannot, because itestimates wrong[?

We are just worried about the businesses that take into account future accidents.(C) Businesses generally do the environmentally ""right"" thing only if doing so makes good business sense. -This will strengthen the argument.

I still don't get the point after reading the discussion. pattoWould you please explain why the correct answer is A instead of D? I still don't get the point after reading the discussion.The cost to adopt measures that would prevent accidents is LOWER than the cost of paying the fine if you have an accident. So, it would be cheaper to adopt the measures to PREVENT the accident than to pay the fine if you have an accident.Based on that information, the author concludes that businesses that might have such accidents will now install adequate environmental safeguards. But what if those businesses think to themselves, ""Well, yes, adopting the measures is cheaper than paying the fines, but we probably won't have an accident so why bother?""If ""businesses generally greatly underestimate the risk of future accidents,"" then they will think that they are probably NOT going to have an accident. If they are probably NOT going to have an accident, why pay all that money adopting preventative measures? Such businesses would NOT install adequate environmental safeguards because they think there is no need. Thus, (A) definitely weakens the argument.(D) is irrelevant. The fines might be an ordinary business expense, but if a business can avoid that expense by replacing it with acheaperexpense (adopting preventative measures), then the business would still want to go with the cheaper option. (D) does not weaken the argument, so (A) is a much better answer._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Need help here.(A) Businesses generallygreatly underestimatethe risk of future accidents. = If the businesses greatly underestimate the risks, that means they have more accidents than predicted .

We don't care if some research is more advanced in one country than another, we only care if they have commercial/national-security value. Besides, ""basic scientific research"" is just out of scope.It took me a while to determine if (B) is relevant. but then I realized if the public have ""detailed knowledge"" of the country's advanced technology, the dissemination would already have been taken place OE as per Kaplan:This one has a weird question stem. “Necessary to rely on” is LSAT code for “a necessaryassumption.” What they’re getting at is that four of the choices are assumptions necessaryto the reasoning; it follows that the right answer must either be outside the scope, orcontradict the text.The issue is this: How freely should advanced technology be passed around? Even ademocracy, the author asserts, must restrict its dissemination when national security orcommercial value is at stake and prohibit access to potential enemies or competitors. Doesthat seem to contradict the last sentence—that free exchange of scientific information isrequired? No: There is a scope difference between scientific information in general, whichthe author argues should be kept free, and advanced technology, which may be restricted.Now, all of that depends on the ability to make a distinction between that which should befreely exchanged and that which may be prohibited, so (D) is an assumption that the authormust make: There has to be a way to separate out the sensitive tech stuff. By the same token,if potential enemies and competitors are to be frozen out, it has to be possible to identify thepotential foes . . . so (A), too, is an assumption necessary to the logic. If either (A) or (D) isin doubt (here’s the Kaplan Denial Test at work), then one could not follow the author’sdictates with confidence.Given their references to things like public policy and multinational corporations, theother two necessary assumptions (a/k/a wrong choices) might not seem within the author’sscope, but they sure prove to be so. The author must rely on (B), that the people in ademocracy don’t need to know all about its advanced technology in order for the countryto function. Why? Because if (B) is false—if the people do need that knowledge—then therestrictions on disseminating advanced technology are utterly inappropriate. Similarly, if(E) is false—if one cannot keep advanced technology from crossing borders more or lesswilly-nilly—then the whole idea of keeping such technology out of the hands of selectedcountries is a ludicrous one. The author must believe, with (E), that multinationalbusinesses notwithstanding, a nation can restrict where its advanced technology is shared.All of the above is moot, of course, if you recognize that (C)’s issue—namely, which type ofpolitical system has more advanced technology—is totally outside the scope of theauthor’s recommendations, which inferably apply to all countries, “even in a democracy.”(That’s what “even” means in this context: The advice is not just restricted to democracies.)With luck you saw (C)’s irrelevant distinction before spending an unwarranted amount oftime on the other four choices.• When a stem indicates that the right answer is an “odd man out,” consider lookingfor it directly as your first line of attack. Slogging through the four wrong choicesmay take more time. Don’t do so unless you have to. Even in a democracy, it is necessary to restrict the dissemination of advanced technological knowledge that is of commercial or national-security value. Dissemination to certain countries, those that are or will be competitors or enemies, should be selectively prohibited. There must, however, be free exchange of scientific information.In order to act in accordance with the position above, it would be necessary to be able to rely on each of the followingEXCEPT:Only problem that one may face is to miss EXCEPT part in question stem.(A) It is possible to distinguish with confidence, despite any changes in the international environment, friendly or noncompetitive from hostile or competitive nations.(B) In a democracy, it is not necessary that the public have detailed knowledge of the country’s advanced technology in order, for example, to make informed decisions about the direction public policy should take.(C) In most fields of science, basic scientific research is further advanced in countries that are democracies than in countries that are not democracies.(D) In each field of science, it is possible to distinguish scientific information from advanced technological knowledge that is of commercial or national-security value.(E) In cases where a company that uses advanced technology is a multinational organization, it is possible to keep information about the technology from being passed across designated national boundaries.C is clearly the differentiator among the five that make no sense to the passage.Two important aspects of the passage are:1. National boundaries - A and E touch on that from national-security point of view.2. Commercial or national-security value and scientific information - D touches that by differentiating.B more or less says what passage mentioned.Answer C._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

So how can we assume the choices of remaining 800 persons. - does not strengthenChoice (C) specifically tells us that 62% of the ENTIRE POTENTIAL READERSHIP would like to have a format change. Without choice (C), it is possible that only a very small portion of the entire readership actually wants a format change. Thus, even if MOST of the readers who support a format change like this change, that would still only represent a tiny portion of overall readership.In other words, say that we somehow knew that MOST people who support a format change actually responded to the survey. Even knowing that information, the survey results would still be meaningless because we do not know what percent of readers want a format change at all.However, with choice (C), we now know that MOST readers would like a format change. Thus, if MOST readers who support a format change actually responded to the survey, then the survey would be evidence that the format change will be a success. True, choice (C) does not PROVE that the change will be a success. It is still possible that most readers who supported a change did not respond to the survey. But choice (C) eliminates a possibility (described in the last paragraph) that would weaken the conclusion. Thus, choice (C) strengthens the argument. If most readers favored a change, it is MORE likely that a greater number responded to the survey and thus MORE likely that the plan will succeed.As for choice (A), we still don't know what percentage of readers received questionnaires. If the survey was only sent to a very small portion of readers, it wouldn't matter that all or most of them returned the survey. It would still be unlikely that the survey accurately represented readers in general.Choice (A) also leaves the possibility that all or most of the readers surveyed supported a format change. And if that only represents a tiny fraction of OVERALL readership, then the survey at best tells us that an even tinier fraction support this specific change. Choice (C) eliminates this possibility, so it is a better answer.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More (A) Of the readers who received questionnires, 90 percent returned them.(C) The percentage of surveyed readers who like the format change was almost the same as the percentage of the entire potential readership who would like format change.(E) Ninety percent of the readers who were dissatisfied with the old format and only 50 percent of the readers who like the old format returned their questionnaires.62% like the old format out of those who returned the questionnaire.But what if the no. of people who have returned  the questionnaire is quite less.

Sixty-two percent of those who returned the questionnaire supported that change. On the basis of this outcome, the decision was made to introduce the new format.Pre-thinking -- was the sample representative of total population in general ?  What if it was only sent to a hundred random magazine readers, out of a million total? Then there would be a good chance that it's not representative.Which one of the following, if it were determined to be true, would provide the best evidence that the journal's decision will have the desired effect?(A) Of the readers who received questionnires, 90 percent returned them.  -- Incorrect -(A) is a worse answer because it leaves open the much more important issue of whether the surveyed readers are representative of the readers in general. Okay, maybe 90 percent returned the questionnaire .... but 90 percent of how many? If only ten people got it, then we haven't necessarily learned much about the readership. We need to know whether the views of the surveyed people correspond to the views of the overall group.(B) Other journals have based format changes on survey results.  -- Irrelevant(C) The percentage of surveyed readers who like the format change was almost the same as the percentage of the entire potential readership who would like format change.  -- strengthens the proposal by establishing that the surveyed group is representative of the magazine's readership in general. I think ""surveyed"" should be interpreted to refer to the people who returned the questionnaire. If a questionnaire shows up in my mailbox and I never open the envelope, we can't say that I have been surveyed.

Since percentage of reader's surveyed resembles general population this option is valid. But what's wrong with A and E?I chose 'A' and got this wrong. I went through explanations and I got why C is correct answer.

It may strengthen, may NOT strengthen.Eliminate.(B) Other journals have based format changes on survey results.<== We are NOT concerned about other journals format changes. Moreover, it still NOT show any relevenace with percentage surveyed and responded and positive responses.Eliminate.(C) The percentage of surveyed readers who like the format change was almost the same as the percentage of the entire potential readership who would like format change.<== May be. but not sure why should we eliminate.Let's keep this.(D) It was determined that the new format would be less costly than the old format.<== But not sure, if it will help in desired effect - readership increase .Eliminate.(E) Ninety percent of the readers who were dissatisfied with the old format and only 50 percent of the readers who like the old format returned their questionnaires.<== This gives percentages of people in both categories that responded to survey but fails to classify, how many (or proportion) in total were in favor of change and how many in total wanted old format only.EliminateSince we are remained with only one option -option C is the final answer.Moreover the option talks about total percentages in favor of change . And since it says percentage 'surveyed' means people who responded- see the highlighted part  - hence its the answer.(C) The percentage ofsurveyedreaders who like the format changewas almost the same as the percentage of theentire potential readershipwho would like format change.Press Kudos, if my efforts have helped in any way and to any extent. The problem with A and E is that we're only provided with percentages -- we don't know the number of people in each group.The goal is toincrease readership.Choice A tells us that of the readers who received questionnaires, 90 percent returned them. But do we know the number of people that received questionnaires? What if this population was only 1% of its readers? A is out.Choice E tells us that ninety percent of the readers who were dissatisfied with the old format and only 50 percent of the readers who like the old format returned their questionnaires. Again, we don't know the number of people in each group. What if only 10 readers were dissatisfied with the old format and 1,000 readers were satisfied? We could end uplosingreaders!Choice C is iron clad -- the 62% is representative of the entire potential readership. C is the answer.

So actually 76 people liked the old format.Also it tells us that the 62 people who liked the new format were 90% of all total who liked the new format so about 69 people liked the new format.Hence, in reality more people liked the old format better and the change may not be good for the magazine.

They concluded that almost all of the decline has been achieved through reduced standards of living and changes in the way people spend their time.Each of the following, if true, would support the conclusion above EXCEPT:The author of the argument has attributed reduced standards of living and changes in the way people spend their time for the decline in the home energy consumption.(A) Sales of portable heaters rose as families concentrated their winter activities in a limited number of rooms.Since the activities are now limited to a number of rooms, this change goes to show that there is a change in the standard of living. Instead of heating the entire house that probably consumed more energy, the people have shifted to portable heaters to heat only certain rooms. SUPPORTS.(B) During the winter months, more people frequented public places such as libraries and community centers and, on the average, spent considerably longer periods in them than they had previously.People now spend more time at public places that show a change in how they spend their time. Also, spending greater time at the public places means that they are saving on the energy consumption at home. SUPPORTS.(C) More than 39 percent of households were able to decrease energy costs substantially by having relatively inexpensive work done to improve the efficiency of their existing heating systems.Inexpensive works don't show any change in the standard of living or how people spend their time. They have simply achieved higher efficiency and thus lower consumption of energy by doing some simple things. DOES NOT SUPPORT.(D) At least 59 percent of households maintained a lower indoor temperature than they had been accustomed to maintain on very cold days.This clearly shows the change in the standard of living in order to lower the energy consumption. SUPPORTS.(E) Members of at least 60 percent of households showered for shorter periods of time than they had previously.Again, a change in the standard of living to lower the energy consumption.

(My emphasis.)Regarding Option E you wrote:Quote:How is the entry of a particular brand say RB here relevant to resolving the paradox?We already know that in the spite of late entry, RB is much liked than others.The timing of the entry of brand R is relevant because the timing explains the low sales.Brand R was too new to get credit for a full year's worth of sales and was at a disadvantage when the data were gathered because new products take time to become known (and purchased).Brand R has the lowest sales figures because:1) it could report onlythreemonths' of sales data. Brands S and T reportedtwelvemonths' of sales data; and2) in contrast to S and T that ""had been available for years,"" R is a new product.New products do not usually enter the market with explosive sales (unless they are a one-off -- thank you Bob Woodward).Armed with this information, now we should not be surprised that R's sales are much lower than those of S and Tfor the only year reported as of now.You mentioned that:Quote:We already know that in the spite of late entry, RB is much liked than others.I think theapparentdeepening of the paradox hijacked you.This option says that DESPITE late entry, R's ratings are still the highest.The paradox seemingly just got worse. Not really. R's newness had anegativeeffect onsales.R's sales are the lowestbecauseR is new.

""Preference"" can't produce sales.And it can't fix themisleadingmethod that comparesthreemonths' of sales reporting totwelvemonths'.Preference is merely a consumer's report of what,ideally,she or he would most prefer to have.""Preference for"" does not inevitably equal ""purchase of.""R has the lowest salesbecauseit is new.

R seems like a market aberration.Four answers will explain why this weird situation has occurred or will illustrate that the inconsistency is not as it appears to be.We must choose the answer that neither explains nor clarifies the oddity.Quote:Can you advise how do we link sales with customers' preferences?Wedon'tlink them. We do not want to link them.Preferences and sales are UNlinked in the prompt, and we leave them unlinked.Rather than trying to link preferences to sales, we need to find options that explain WHY preferences and sales arenotlinked.Four answers, ready-made, will shed light on the anomalous disconnection. One answer will not.Quote:Do not we link sales with either revenue, profit or no of units sold?No. We don't care about measuring, predicting, or defining sales. Neither the question nor the options point in that direction.I can't tell why you got attached to the specific idea of connecting preferences to sales, or connecting sales to something else.My experience with paradox and disparity questions indicates that we should avoid highly specific lines of thought.There are too many ways to explain an oddity. Let the options do the work for you.We care about what does and does not explain the odd relationship between high ratings and low sales.Instead of being attached to a particular result we can ask about each option, ""Does this answer help to resolve the paradox?""If the option HELPS to explain, eliminate that option. If the option does NOT help to explain, you have found the correct answer.(A)Texas T Beans and Aunt Sally’s Beans are each much less expensive than R-Bar Beans.[a.k.a.

People cannot buy what grocers do not sell.(E)R-Bar Beans were only introduced to the market only three months prior to the calculation of sales figures,while Texas T Beans and Aunt Sally’s Beans had been available for years.--Helpsto explain. Sales data either are not representative or are just a dumb yardstick by whichto measure R against S and T. R is too new and has had too few months to report sales data.So we have(A) R is comparatively too expensive (high price drives sales down)(C) survey of preferences is from a small region - not representative of national preferences(D) R is not even offered for sale in most stores(E) R has three months' of sales data. S and T had 12 months' of data. Comparatively low sales of R now make sense.Those 4 answers do not try to uncouple R's high ratings from R's low sales figures. They give a reason for the gap's existence or show that the gap is only an appearance.We needed one answer that did not help to explain why R brand seemed to be a market misfit.(B) is that answer.Hope that helps._________________— The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.Einstein— I stand with Ukraine:Donate to Help Ukraine!Signature Read More nahid007A recent survey of brand preferences showed that R-Bar Beans are considered the best of all brands among all age groups, leading both Texas T Beans and Aunt Sally’s Beans by a wide margin.

This is a flawed argument in which author relates the popularity of a product with it's sales.In the real world and  the GMAT world alike, this may not be the case. A product may be considered the best in business with relatively poor sales.A classical example that comes to my mind is that of a popular brand of floaters.That brand say 'x' appeals to the teenagers, but is not bought by most of them because of it's cost. Though popular, it's not purchased because of cost.A - this is what I discussed above  - INCORRECTC -this indicates that the survey was probably not representative. - INCORRECTD - this explains the reason behind the low sales of R- beans. - INCORRECTE - this explains that the comparison between the sales figures was premature. - INCORRECTB - CORRECTSent from my ONE E1003 usingGMAT Club Forum mobile app Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Note that generally only facts make conclusions stronger or weaker. Opinion of some does not.(D) Other cities include gunshot wound cases in their category o top-priority emergencies.There is no right or wrong way to define top-priority emergencies. We know that it included gunshot wounds last year but the definition has now been changed to not include gun shot wounds. IT doesn't make the definition wrong, just different. This difference has led to the misrepresentation.How other cities define top-priority emergencies is irrelevant. We just care about last year vs this year in our city.(E) One half of all of last year’s top-priority emergencies were gunshot wounds and electrocution cases.If a big part of last year's emergencies were gunshot wounds & elec and this year, they are not included, this could explain the reduction in the average turnaround time. If last year gunshot wounds and elec accounted for a very small part of top priority emergencies, not including them would not have made much difference at all. But since a big part of last year emergencies weer gunshot wounds & elec, it does make sense that not including them will reduce the turnaround time without any actual difference on ground.Hence (E) is correct._________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More noboruThe mayor boasts that the average ambulance turnaround time, the time from summons to delivery of the patient, has been reduced this year for top-priority emergencies.

Thus this somehow supports the conclusion better than others.Why no A?If the number of heart attacks and strokes declined this year; and these are actually the top priority cases, that somehow also strengthen the conclusion, does not it?Thanks. noboruWhy no A?If the number of heart attacks and strokes declined this year; and these are actually the top priority cases, that somehow also strengthen the conclusion, does not it?Thanks.I agree with E for the above explanations.Noboru, I would say that A in not good because what the argument focuses on is the fact that the mayorredefinedthe top priorities.To strenghten the argument we need to continue to focus on this by showing how the fact that the top priorities emergencies no longer include the shotgun wounds and electructions had an impact on the decreased average time.With A, we only show that the heart attacks and strokes declined, but this doesn't help without knowing about the shotgun wounds and electructions.Hope this helps...can you confirm OA? (A) is clearly out, since the argument says ""time reduction"" for the ""Top Priority Emergencies"" in current year. As compared to the last year time consuming tasks like gunshots/ electro.. excluded in current year. So if these ""time consuming tasks"" occupy more than 50% of the jobs in last year than this certainly strengthen the conclusion that redefining (removing time consuming jobs) top priority does reduce the time.E is correct answer!!!!90 Seconds, probably not too quick for a 700.

For the criminologist question, the reason that the embezzlement one is eliminated is because the other option is far better. Though it is not recommended to go about eliminating answers this way, for the criminal one you have to assume that embezzlement and robbery are similar. I personally did not like the question because of that flaw._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

I beieve this is one of the best ways to improve in CR. Don't just do questions, but try to extract as much as possible from each of them. I think doing blind review help a lot in doing so (more about blind review here:https://gmatclub.com/forum/mod-nightbla%20...%2095316.html)Here is the stimulus:The mayor boasts that the average ambulance turnaround time, the time from summons to delivery of the patient, has been reduced this year for top-priority emergencies. This is a serious misrepresentation. This “reduction” was produced simply by redefining “top priority.” Such emergencies used to include gunshot wounds and electrocutions, the most time-consuming cases. Now they are limited strictly to heart attacks and strokes.Initial thoughts: Ok this is a strenghten question, so let's try to find out a gap in the argument. Then the option could stregnthen the argument by filling one of these gaps.1º Premise: Turnaround times has been reduced for top priority emergencies2º Premise: Top prioroty emergencies used to include gunshot wounds and electrocution. Now they include heart attacks and strokesConclusion: Reduction is due to a change of what top priority emergencies include and not due to reduction of time of the emergencies themselvesIs the redefinition of top priorities enough to say that that's the reason why the times have decreased. Well, the argument says that they used to include the most-time consuming cases and now they are not included. So it is reasonable to state that. But what if heart attacks and strokes are now more time-consuming than gunshot wounds and electrocutions. mmm, it could be and we would need to eliminate that possibility to strengthen the argument. In addition, other time-consuming cases could have been included and the elmination of this possibility would strengthen the argument. Ok, enough. Let's read the choices with all these thoughts in mind.(A) The number of heart attacks and strokes declined this year.Ok. They declined. By how much? we don't know. Does this decline impact the average turnaround time of heart attacks and strokes. No. So this option doesn't help.Incorrect(B) The mayor redefined the city’s financial priorities this year.Financial priorities? This is not related in any way with average turnaround time.Incorrect(C) Experts disagree with the mayor’s definition of “top-priority emergency.”mm. They disagree with the mayor's definitions and they are experts. Do we know what experts base their definition of top priority emergencies? No, it's not said anywhere. We don't know if they consider time around time or severity of the cases to define top priority emergencies so this option doesn't help.Incorrect(D) Other cities include gunshot wound cases in their category of top-priority emergencies.We are trying to strengthen why the average time went down regardless of if gunshot wound cases removal is good or not. It doesn't address the main conclusion.Incorrect(E) One half of all of last year’s top-priority emergencies were gunshot wounds and electrocution cases.mmm. This one doesn't sound bad. We didn't know anything about the percentage that gunshot wounds and electrocution cases had. It could have been 1% of the total, in which case the removal wouldn't have impacted that much the average time, or it could be much more. Since we know that one half were the most time-consuming cases, then for sure average time has gone down because of the removal of these cases.CorrectOption E Is this an LSAT question or anOGquestion? Source is specified as LSAT though I found it in OG2020.Does GMAC takes up LSAT question at times for GMAT?

IMOCThe energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?(A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals --> counterfact(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can --> it's not about the speed of large animals to small animals, it's about speed of each in uphill in compared with each' speed in flat ground(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals -->the best. Because such ratio of large animals is not equal to that of small animals, large animals can;t remain its speed when moving uphill as can small animals when moving uphill(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals --> no influence(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal -->not qualified enough to be basis of the argument The answer is C.1) The argument above says that the energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight and the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area.2) Small animals can run up fast and the large animals slow down when moving up.The second statement can only be true if we assume that the energy output of large animals is less than what is required and the energy output of small animals is more than what is required. From 1) it implies that surface area to body weight ratio is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals..Hence option C. ""C"" for sure!!Explanations are provided next to the answer choices!!jainuThe energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?(A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals.It is contradicting the argument,which clearly states that the energy needed is directly proportional to the body weight!!(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can.One can not assume that small animals are more agile than the large ones for the information given in the argument says only about uphill movement!e.a. leopard might be quicker than squirrel on flat surface but he might not be quicker than squirrel in uphill movement!!(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals.This is the best choice as the amount of energy available for use is directly proportional to the body's surface area & amount of energy expended is directly proportion to the body weight. thus S.A./B.W. must be more to move quickly (uphill)(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals.By this logic all the animals should move uphill at almost same speed.(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal.One of the premises mentioned in the argument.Please provide the reasoning. let ratio for large animals = S/ERatio for small animals = s/eoption C: S/E < s/e.........when inverted looks like this:E/S > e/s........ that is:energy expended per unit space (for large animals) > that for small animals...tallies with the stimulusthats the kind of representation i was looking for , Got C in3:00 min (A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals.WRONG. Because the author agrees energies are different for different sizes.(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can.WRONG. This is the Premise so can't be the assumption.(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals.CORRECT(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals.WRONG. There is a lot of variation for larger animals ratio is higher and smaller animals ratio is smaller.(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal.WRONG. Speeds are irrelevant to the argument. We are discussing only energies needed. The energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?(A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals.- Negating the information already provided in the Premise(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can.- Provided in the premise already(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals.- This provides the most appropriate assumption -Correct(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals.- If this is assumed, then both large and small animals should be able to move fast. Does not justify to be an assumption.(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal.- Irrelevant information Though my reply is a bit late, still I shall not suffice just by solving and not by sharing.ENERGY EXPENDED~ WEIGHT OF THE ANIMALENERGY OUTPUT ~ SURFACE AREA OF THE ANIMALCLEARLY SURFACE AREA ~ WEIGHT,let surface area be denoted by A and weight be W.The more is A/W, the more is the energy output/energy expended.If an option states that the ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals, then for sure the ratio of energy output/energy expended is much less than that of smaller animals.Hence c is the clear winner. I chose C.It clearly answers the question: bigger body weight means more energy output is needed to move uhill. Lower surface area means lower energy output. So in combination, this means slower uphill movement.A is wrong. IMO, it weakens the conclusion. Because if energy amount is the same, then larger animals should be faster due to bigger surface area.B looks irrelevant to meD looks again irrelevant since the ratio of energy output to BW is not discussed in the question stemE provides additional information which does not contribute to the logic of the author.and it also talks about running while we are interested about moving uphill let us simplify what the question says -Energy required = constant * body weightEnergy output = constant * surface area.Now, (energy output) / (energy required) = constant * (surface area) / (body weight)We are told that smaller mammals can run almost as fast as they can on ground, whereas large mammals tend to slow down.this means that energy output is more than able to meet the energy required in smaller mammals (that is why they do not slow down).Whereas it is less in larger mammals (they slow down because they are not able to meet energy requirements)Hence, ratio > 1 (in larger mammals) and < 1 (in smaller mammals). If we compare the two ratios, we get -(surface area)/ (body weight) [for small mammals] > (surface area)/ (body weight) [for large mammals]Which option states this? Option C.A - Incorrect.Not true. We know that they require more energy as their body weight is more.B - Incorrect.We do not know whether they can actually run at higher speeds than larger mammals. All we know is that they do not slow when moving uphill but larger mammals do.We do not have any idea about their actual speeds.Moreover, we have data only when they move uphill. Other scenarios are not known.D - Incorrect.We know that (energy output/surface area) is constant. We don't have any idea about (energy output/ body weight).E - Incorrect.Energy required is proportional to the body weight. We cannot infer about surface area._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More Quote:The energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area.

Fist of all you have a look at the question in such a manner that you understand as to how the conclusion was derived. You identified the conclusion correctly, but understand how the author reached at it.Energy Input to the body ~ Body WeightEnergy Output to the body ~ Surface AreaIt's nature's law that the surface area of large animals will be greater than the surface area of small animals. Another law of nature is that while moving uphill a person has to put in more efforts because of the gravitational force. Thus, if the surface area/body weight is smaller in large animals then it means that the Output/Input is less. If the output is less than that would definitely mean that the smaller animals would be faster. Thus, ""C"" is correct.Quote:The energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?(A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals. --This is only talking about the Energy input. But we know that the equation can change with different Output. We need to know both the parameters. Not sufficient.(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can. --This is just restatement of the conclusion.(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals. --Correct as explained above(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals. --We are not worried about Output/Input ratio's variation. We need to understand the difference in ratio of different animals. Insuffieicnt.(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal. --This is just reinstatement of the premise. We already know Energy output ~ Surface AreaHope this helps!Regards Kaplan Official Explanation:We’re looking for an assumption in an explanation, so your first task is to locate the explanation and the observation it is supposed to explain. The Keyword phrase “This is the reason that . . .” gives the structure away: The first sentence is meant to explain the observation discussed in the second sentence. Squirrels can run up steep inclines very quickly whereas large animals slow down while moving uphill. What is it about squirrels that gives them the edge? The explanation claims that the energy required to run uphill is proportional to body weight, but the energy available to run uphill is proportional to surface area. So the animals that have an easier time running uphill have relatively more surface area as compared to their body weight. How does this apply to the observation about squirrels? We know that squirrels weigh less than larger animals, and so they don’t need as much energy to run up hills, but we can also infer that squirrels have less surface area than larger animals, and so they have less energy available to do the job. So while squirrels have an advantage in one aspect (body weight), they have a disadvantage in another (surface area). So what else has to be true about squirrels?As (C) puts it, squirrels must have a high surface area to weight ratio, which means that they have more surface area relative to their body weight. (C) fills in the gap by explaining why the squirrels’ disadvantage in surface area is more than compensated by their advantage in body weight. Squirrels may have a little less energy to do the job, but this is more than made up by the fact that larger animals are much, much heavier.(A) Au-contraire: In the event that large animals weigh more than small animals (which is most likely the case), the first line of the stimulus supports the opposite of (A).(B) The issue here is moving uphill. The explanation therefore need not rely on any comparison of the general speed of small and large animals. Moreover, (B) ignores the surface area issue and thus fails to tie together the theory and the phenomenon it’s meant to explain.(D) and (E) both focus on ratios that are never mentioned in the stimulus (energy output is proportional to surface area; energy needed is proportional to weight), so there’s no way that either of these can be the assumption on which the explanation depends. Moreover, (E) has the same problem as (A)— “run” is simply too general because the stimulus focuses on moving uphill. jainuThe energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?(A) The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals that it is for small animals.(B) Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can.(C) The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals.(D) There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals.(E) The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal.Source: LSATGiven:1. The energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight2. The animal’s energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area.This is the reason that small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.Asked:Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?Energy consumed = K1 * Body WeightEnergy output = K2 * Surface AreaEnergy Efficiency = Energy output / Energy consumed = K3 * (Surface area / Body Weight)Since energy efficiency is less for larger animals as compared to smaller animals, small animals, like squirrel, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.For the statement to be TRUE ratio of surface area to body weight should be smaller in larger animals than it is in small animals.IMO C If you are rookie enough to overlook that option A B E can be eliminated straight, then this may not be helpful to you.If you have eliminated A B E, good!!Now D talks about relation between OUTPUT ENERGY and BODY WEIGHT where as passage does not talk about this relation.passage talks about  relation between OUTPUT ENERGY and SURFACE AREA.so option D eliminated.Mark option C and move on.kudos to me!!

Proportionality is nowhere given attention or taken care of.(B) Small animals canmove more rapidly thanlarge animals can. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(C) Theratio of surface area to body weight is smallerin large animals than it is in small animals. - CORRECT.

It states clearly that violations ""committed by governments that represent the will of the people are even more reprehensible than those committed by dictators."" So we know that some violations are more reprehensible than others. The author is using this to explain why we should be more upset by violations committed by democracies than by *more violent* violations committed by dictators. So apparently actions by democracies can be more reprehensible than these more violent violations, because they are performed by those who are supposed to be representing the will of the people.E isn't valid because we are only told that democracies are more responsive than dictatorships.

For these question types our goal is to use the statements in the stimulus and see how they interact with another in order to be able to make a feasible inference. For example, if I say I like movies that have a lot of action in them and then later make the assertion that a new movie that is about to come out is critically acclaimed as the most action packed movie in decades then you could be able to reasonably infer that I will like this new movie that is about to come out. You can infer this simply by combining the elements of my first statement and second statement and see how the two logically connect.In this question we are told in the first sentence that it is more important to criticize democracies that commit human rights violations than dictatorships. Why? Because it is even more reprehensible to commit human rights violations when you are supposed to represent the will of the people (a democracy) than when the government is a dictatorship. And lastly the argument says that criticism directed towards democracies would have more of an effect than if they were directed towards dictatorships.Answer choices:A) Incorrect - ""All"" should be an immediate red flag here and should always prompt your suspicion when you're dealing with a must be true question and 'All' shows up in one of the answer choices.

The first sentence says that democracies should be criticized more than dictatorships that commit ""more violent human rights offenses"" and the second statement says democracies are more reprehensible than dictatorships. Combining the elements of both statements we can infer what B is saying.C) we can't infer this; ""certain"" is much too strong and we don't know what effect, if at all, criticism would have on dictatorshipsD) Also not supported; we don't know what the likelihood is in either scenarioE) is a little tricky and it may be tempting at first to give this answer choice some thought. But this actually says the opposite of what the stim says by saying that democracies would be less likely to be moved by criticism when the stimulus says they would be more likely. Also this answer choice makes the distinction between those that ""merely claim to represent the will of the people"" and those that do in fact represent the will of the people, but we know nothing about those who ""merely claim"" to do so.

OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONIf time is tight—or you find that you cannot follow the argument as presented—this one is practically screaming, “Skip me for now; come back to me later on.” Handling it requires a firm grasp on the comparisons offered, as well as on the direct relationship that is the author’s conclusion. Let’s start with that. According to the author, one will find a higher percentage of older male ducks when there is a great disparity in sex ratios overall (i.e. all males : all females). How come? Because among older ducks there are a lot more males, whereas among younger ducks the male : female ratio is much closer to 1 : 1. In other words, the more the male ducks strongly outnumber the females, the likelier it is that the older males will outnumber the younger ones.Compare the male : female ratio at the two lakes in question. The western lake’s is close to 1 : 1 (55 : 45), while the eastern lake’s is almost 2 : 1 (65 : 35). Which lake, according to the conclusion, should have a greater percentage of older males? The eastern—that’s the lake with the greater male : female disparity. So the western lake should have a lower percentage of older males . . . and that’s just what (A) points out.(B) The data in the argument compare the ages of adult and nonadult males. We cannot draw (B)’s conclusion about adult vs. nonadult ducks—males and females combined.(C) No conclusion about a total population can be drawn from a male : female ratio. Contrary to (C), the western lake could have many more male ducks than the eastern, so long as the western’s population reduces to 55 : 45 and the eastern’s to 65 : 35.(D) introduces an issue—hatching time—that is totally removed from the argument. Hence, (D) is completely unacceptable as an inference.(E)’s conclusion about the age ratio of adult females : nonadult females is unjustified, because no data comparing those groups are provided. The conclusion only concerns males. broallA population of game ducks at a western lake contains 55 males to every 45 females, while a population of game ducks at an eastern lake contains 65 males for every 35 females. Among those ducks that have not yet bred there are only slightly more males than females, but among older ducks the number of males greatly exceeds the number of females. Because there are appreciably more males among adult ducks than among young ducks, we can infer that the greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The population of game duck at the western lake contains a lower percentage of adult males than the population at the eastern lake contains.(B) The population of game duck at the eastern lake contains a higher percentage of nonadult game ducks than the population at the western lake contains.(C) The total number of male game ducks is higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake population.(D) The number of nonadult ducks hatched in a breeding season is higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake’s population.(E) Adult female game ducks outnumber nonadult female game ducks in the eastern lake’s population.Source: LSATWe know basically two things, but they are separated in the text by a vast distance so it's hard to put them together.1. A population of game ducks at a western lake contains 55 males to every 45 females, while a population of game ducks at an eastern lake contains 65 males for every 35 females.2. the greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population.With these two pieces of information we can infer that Eastern Lake is older than Western Lake.(A) says that Western Lake is younger, which is the same thing as the Eastern Lake is older. So this is the correct answer.(B) says the Eastern Lake is younger, which is the opposite of what we can infer.(C) says nothing about which lake is older. Also, from the stimulus we know information about percentages, nothing about amounts of ducks. Depending on which lake was bigger the claim could be severely challenged.(D) is out of scope. We know nothing about the ducks hatched in a breeding season.(E) twists around the second claim we know to be true. The second claim says that the greater the disparity in sex ratios the greater the percentage of older male ducks. It says nothing of the percentage of older female ducks. broallA population of game ducks at a western lake contains 55 males to every 45 females, while a population of game ducks at an eastern lake contains 65 males for every 35 females.

Because there are appreciably more males among adult ducks than among young ducks, we can infer that the greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population.For Inference questions, we have to assume that everything mentioned in the stem is completely true, including the conclusion! This was the tricky aspect.Conclusion mentions: ""greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population""Thus, Percentage of older male ducks in Western lake < Percentage of older male ducks in Eastern lake(A) The population of game duck at the western lake contains a lower percentage of adult males than the population at the eastern lake contains.In line with our prediction.(B) The population of game duck at the eastern lake contains a higher percentage ofnonadultgame ducks than the population at the western lake contains.Tempting! But we have no information about percentage ofNonadultducks(C) The total number of male game ducks is higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake population.Out of scope: Conclusion only talks about percentages.(D) The number of nonadult ducks hatched in a breeding season is higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake’s population.Out of scope: Conclusion only talks about percentages. Moreover, there's no mention of breeding season(E) Adult female game ducks outnumber nonadult female game ducks in the eastern lake’s population.Out of scope: Conclusion only talks about percentages of older male ducks.Please do let me know if I overlooked anything! Took me five minutes to understand that ""ducks that have not yet bred"" was the same thing as ""young ducks"".I dont think this is obvious. What if half of the older ducks have not yet bred?Posted from my mobile device Definitely a difficult question. Between A and B.But we don't have any idea about the number of non-adult ducks. Option A wins. A population of game ducks at a western lake contains 55 males to every 45 females, while a population of game ducks at an eastern lake contains 65 males for every 35 females. Among those ducks that have not yet bred there are only slightly more males than females, but among older ducks the number of males greatly exceeds the number of females. Because there are appreciably more males among adult ducks than among young ducks, we can infer that the greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The population of game duck at the western lake contains alower percentage of adult malesthan the population at the eastern lake contains. - CORRECT. Less ratio of M and F in western lake compared to eastern lake suggests that eastern contains higher percentage of adult males.(B) The population of game duck at the eastern lake contains ahigher percentage of nonadult game ducksthan the population at the western lake contains. - WRONG. Nonadult game ducks include both male and female. This can't be concluded though it's opposite to A.(C) Thetotal number of male game ducksis higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake population. - WRONG. If one misread the passage this one's going to be the answer for them. Passage gives us a ratio in a deceiving language that needs attention.(D) The number of nonadult duckshatched in a breeding seasonis higher in the eastern lake’s population than in the western lake’s population. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(E) Adult female game ducksoutnumbernonadult female game ducks in the eastern lake’s population. - WRONG. Opposite.The most difficult choice is B and rest are easy EXCEPT C.Answer A._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More The author is saying that when there's a big difference between the number of male and female ducks overall, it means there's a higher percentage of older male ducks in the group. This is because among the older ducks, there are way more males than females, but among the younger ducks, the numbers of males and females are pretty similar.Now, let's look at the two lakes. The western lake has 55 males for every 45 females, which is close to a 1:1 ratio. On the other hand, the eastern lake has 65 males for every 35 females, which is almost a 2:1 ratio. According to the author's conclusion, the eastern lake should have a higher percentage of older male ducks because of this bigger difference between males and females.So, it makes sense that the western lake would have a lower percentage of older males compared to the eastern lake, and that's exactly what choice (A) is saying. The other choices don't work because they either compare things that aren't supported by the information given, bring up unrelated stuff, or just can't be figured out from the male-to-female ratios alone.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/a-population-of-game-ducks-at-a-western-lake-contains-249820.html

Otherwise, the orchestra would never be able to appreciate the conductor's vision, and so by it's terms, he/she would never be able to insist on more practice.(A) for EVERY orchestra they devise different interpretations?(B) NEVER satisfied even by a TOP orchestra?(C) They're ALWAYS ready to put in more work?If you negate this, you're saying""At least one time, a top orchestra was not willing to put in additional work even when the conductor considered it necessary"".This doesn't hurt the author's argument at all.First of all, this answer doesn't specify we're dealing with a ""superior conductor"". The author would happily agree to the negation of (C). She would say, ""Of course! When a mediocre conductor insists extra rehearsal is necessary, a top orchestra might not agree and not be ready to put in additional work.""Even with a top conductor, the author never made it sound like a guarantee that the top orchestra would ALWAYS agree to do the extra work.Her specific point is that a top conductor can't just CLAIM ""we need more rehearsals"" (the idea being that simply claiming it wouldn't impel the orchestra to do the extra practice).The top conductor gets the orchestra to believe in the interpretation the conductor is pursuing (with the idea being that once the orchestra believes in the interpretation, they will be self-motivated to put in the extra practice). For me the answer is D.(D) Top orchestras can appreciate the merits of an interpretation even before they have brought it to full realization.It is the mark of a superior conductor that he or she has the authority to insist, even with a top orchestra, that rehearsal work must be intensified. This authority cannot simply be claimed, the conductor must earn it by winning the orchestra’s respect for the artistic interpretations he or she is currently pursuing.Since the authority needs to be earned for artistic interpretation, the orchestra should know when the interpretation is good and hence can provide the authority. D is the answer. But i feel the argument lacks a conclusion. Second sentence in the argument is just another  statement and it presupposes D. I thought that the 1st line was the conclusion here. Went on to negate it - Authority to intensify practices of fellow musicians might not be linked to one being a superior conductor. Marked C - since it says that irrespective of the status of conductor, the orchestra puts in the work if the conductor feels so.Can someone (experts) kindly guide me how to identify the conclusions in such statements - where a 'since __ therefore __' structure doesn't fit.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/it-is-the-mark-of-a-superior-conductor-that-he-or-she-249823.html

(D) is a classic case of this. Why does it matter whether rubber was the original substance for ball construction?The argument is dating the invention of the game based on when rubber was invented (or first used). Synthetic materials in modern basketballs were probably invented in the last decade. When was basketball invented? What if the Mexicans played with the heads of their enemies for thousands of years and then switched to rubber when they discovered it in the year 1000 because it bounced better? So the only way this argument can work is if the game was played from the beginning with rubber. (D) removes this ""heads of enemies"" possibility.(A) is actually out of scope. We care about when it was invented not why/when it was played.(B) The conclusion is that the game was invented some time between 1000 and 1519. If it was the very last thing the Mexicans did before Cortez arrived (I'm applying the negation test here), the argument still works. This isn't necessary for the argument.(C) is also out of scope. We don't care where in Mexico it was popular. We only care when it was invented.(E) is inviting us to question the premise that rubber was first used in 1000 A.D. (E) tells us that Cortez was the one who determined when the Mexicans started using rubber. For the purposes of the LSAT, Daffy Duck could have been the archeologist who determined when the Mexicans invented rubber. If we're given that as a premise, we can take it to the bank. Remember, we are addressing the gap between the premise and the conclusion---not questioning the premise or the conclusion themselves.

A gives an alternate cause, as you pointed out, so it directly refutes the conclusion.I think you became confused with the premise and the conclusion.Does this help?Thanks for your explanation_________________- StneSignature Read More A recent study found that snoring, though not common in either group, is more common among smokers than among nonsmokers. On the basis of this evidence, the author hypothesized that smoking by itself can induce snoring.Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the author’s hypothesis?(A) Stress induces both snoring and smoking in certain individuals. -Correct. From the premise we know that ""most"" smokers/non-smokers don't snore. So among the remaining few people stress induces both smoking and snoring habit.(B) Obesity induces many individuals to smoke. -Out of scope. The argument is about snore and not smoke.(C) Most snorers do not smoke. -We already know this from the premise. This is just restatement of the aforesaid fact.(D) Most smokers do not snore. -We already know this from the premise.

Hi,I have gone through the explanations in the thread below, but still fail to understand the logic:Option A: ""Stress induces both snoring and smoking in certain individuals"". Though this option provides a new source that induces snoring apart from smoking, but it does not say anything about people without stress but who smoke. What about these people do they snore or not?Option D: ""Most smokers do not sore"". This directly deals with the conclusion. It presents a fact that is exactly opposite of the conclusion. Most smokers do not snore and hence smoking has not induced snoring in many peopleHence, shouldn't the answer be option D?Thanks!

However, it certainlyweakensthe author's reasoning. The author reasons that since snoring is more common among smokers, smokingby itselfmust be causing some people to snore. Choice (A) tells us that at least some of the smokers who snore are snoring because of stress not because they smoke. Perhaps if stress were not a factor, smokers and nonsmokers would be equally likely to snore. But because stress induces smoking AND snoring, the data, on which the hypothesis is based, is misleading.As for choice (D), the conclusion is that smokingby itselfcan induce snoring. This does not say that smoking always or even usually induces snoring. Rather, it says that smoking, by itself,caninduce snoring. The author's hypothesis does not require that most smokers snore. In fact, the passage even states that snoring is not common among smokers. This fact does not impact the author's reasoning, so choice (D) can be eliminated. As long assomesmokers snore, the author's hypothesis is feasible._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More broallA recent study found that snoring, though not common in either group, is more common among smokers than among nonsmokers.

We know A is correlated with B, and the author assumes A therefore must cause B. Classic rebuttals to this are:1) reverse causation: B might cause A2) third party: C might cause both A and B3) coincidence!(A) nails the target by introducing a third party, stress, that could be responsible for causing both snoring and smoking, which would handily explain the correlation.Not the Problem(B) This doesn't explain the connection to snoring.(C) The conclusion was only that smoking could induce snoring, not that it was the only possible way to induce snoring. If most snorers don't smoke, then their snoring is caused by something other than smoking, but that's okay - it doesn't damage the conclusion.(D) We were already told this in the premise!(E) Who cares what smoking and snoring cause, we want to know what causes THEM! Option D is contradicting the fact by saying MOST (more than 50%) smokers do not snore.

Shouldn't an inference be anything else but a restatement? Isn't option d the right answer?Quote:(A) All of the picture-winged drosophilids in Hawaii are believed to be the descendants of the same one or two ancestral female fruit flies.An inference can sometimes be a simple rephrasing of given information. In this case, you technically have to synthesize information from the last two sentences:In Hawaii, there are 106 species of a subset of fruit flies called the picture-winged drosophilids.Since ""all of the fruit fly species now present in the Hawaiian archipelago are thought to be the descendants of the same one or two ancestral females,"" all of the picture-winged drosophilids in Hawaii are also thought to be the descendants of the same one or two ancestral female fruit flies.This might seem fairly obvious, but it is a valid inference. More importantly, see how you can eliminate the other choices. For example:Quote:(D) If 500 new species of fruit flies were discovered, then Hawaiian fruit flies would no longer be the most taxonomically diversepopulation.Choice (D) is not necessarily true. What if those 500 new species are discovered in numerous locations all over the world (i.e. 50 new species in each of 10 different places)? It's possible that Hawaii would no longer be the most taxonomically diverse place, but without information about the numbers in other places after the discovery, we can't know for sure._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More broallOnly 1,000 to 2,000 species of fruit flies exist worldwide.

It had previously been assumed that birds developed only after the close of the Mesozoic era and after the disappearance of pterosaurs, a species characteristic of that era. But there in limestone lay the imprint of a fully aerodynamic, three-inch-long feather. This, therefore, must have been the earliest bird—certainly the earliest found to the date.The argument assumes which one of the following?As per the passage Pterosaurs was very common in Mesozoic era and birds developed near the end of this era and after the disappearance of pterosaurs. However, a fully aerodynamic three-inch-long feather was discovered in Mesozoic era limestone slab. Hence author concludes that the feather must have been that of the earliest bird. Clearly, author assumes that Pterosaurs or any other bird like animal didn't had an such sort of feature - feather.(A) The creature to which the feather belonged was a descendant of the pterosaurs. - WRONG. Whether a descendant or not it does not matter since that slab belonged to Mesozoic era by the end of which pterosaurs disappeared.(B) Birds with such feathers were preceded by species of birds with less-developed feathers. - WRONG. Irrelevant. Not concerned whether feather developed fully or not.(C) In the Mesozoic era, no creatures other than birds had such feathers. - CORRECT. Since the argument talks about the earliest bird it can be said that no other creature, which might have developed before mesozoic era, had such feathers. Also, on negating we get that 'other creature had such feathers' which breaks the argument's claim that it must have been the earliest bird.(D) The feather belonged to a Mesozoic creature that was neither a pterosaur nor a bird, but intermediate between them. - WRONG. If the feather belonged to an intermediate creature(E) The earliest bird flew in an awkward manner. - WRONG. Irrelevant. Does n't impact the argument.IMO Answer C._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Notes: if the feather was of a non-bird species, then the argument falls - since the conclusion is that the feather supports a bird before the mezo era.Ans (C) Let's negate each choice to find the correct assumptionA) doesn’t hurt the argument when negated, but rather helps it... Negated: Feather does not belong to pterosaurs.B) doesn’t do anything to the argument when negated. This is just giving us information.C) is the CORRECT ANSWER.  Negated: In the Mesozoic era, creatures other than birds have feathers. This would lead us to believe that these feathers may have belonged to something else that wasn’t a bird, which would destroy this argument. With this, we can't conclude that this was a bird feather.D) even helps the argument if negated. When negated, it’s saying that the feather did not belong to a creature which was in between a pterosaur or bird. This could still have belonged to a bird.E) doesn’t do anything to the argument when negated. Whether the earliest bird flew properly or not doesn't matter.FINAL ANSWER IS (C) In 1860 Bavarian quarry workers discovered the impression of a feather in a limestone slab dating to the Mesozoic era. It had previously been assumed that birds developed only after the close of the Mesozoic era and after the disappearance of pterosaurs, a species characteristic of that era. But there in limestone lay the imprint of a fully aerodynamic, three-inch-long feather. This, therefore, must have been the earliest bird—certainly the earliest found to the date.Stimulus: It states that the bird feather found in the limestone stab of the Mesozoic era must be the earliest found bird as initially it was believed that birds existed only in the pterosaurs after the close of mesozoic era. The author assumes that no other species could have feather other than bird.The argument assumes which one of the following?IMO C(A) The creature to which the feather belonged was a descendant of the pterosaurs.(B) Birds with such feathers were preceded by species of birds with less-developed feathers.(C) In the Mesozoic era, no creatures other than birds had such feathers.Correct(D) The feather belonged to a Mesozoic creature that was neither a pterosaur nor a bird, but intermediate between them.(E) The earliest bird flew in an awkward manner. (B) Birds with such feathers were preceded by species of birds with less-developed feathers.Answer: B C as argument suggests that bird must have been there in early era. So, bird would be the only creature with feathers.Posted from my mobile device",https://gmatclub.com/forum/in-1860-bavarian-quarry-workers-discovered-the-impression-249895.html
"Despite improvements in treatment for asthma, the death rate form this disease has doubled during the past decade from its previous rate.

Second, there has been an increase in urban pollution. However, since the rate of deaths due to asthma has increased dramatically even in cities with long-standing, comprehensive medical records and with little or no urban pollution, one must instead conclude that the cause of increased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthma sufferers to relieve their symptoms.Each of the following, if true, provides support to the argument EXCEPT:(A) Urban populations have doubled in the past decade.(B) Records of asthma deaths are as accurate for the past twenty years as for the past ten years.(C) Evidence suggests that bronchial inhalers make the lungs more sensitive to irritation by airborne pollen.(D) By temporarily relieving the symptoms of asthma, inhalers encourage sufferers to avoid more beneficial measures.(E) Ten years ago bronchial inhalers were not available as an asthma treatment.""Despite improvements in treatment for asthma"" Assumption QuestionShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","Hi,I can see that some of the members have shared good analysis of the questions but still some of the doubts keep cropping up again. Let me add my two cents to it:Let's first understand the passage:Understanding the PassageDespite improvements in treatment for asthma, the death rate form this disease has doubled during the past decade from its previous rate. -So, we have an unexpected thing here: death rate from Asthma increased even though there have been improvements in the treatment.Two possible explanations for this increase have been offered. -We have two possible explanations for the unexpected thing.First, the recording of deaths due to asthma has become more widespread and accurate in the past decade than it had been previously. -This means that probably the death rate has not increased per se but now, we are recording more deaths for every 100 deaths. For example: in the past, we used to record only 40 deaths for 100 actual deaths but now, we record, say, 70 deaths for every 100 deaths. So, this explains the increase in death rate observed even though we have better treatment.Second, there has been an increase in urban pollution. -This means that one adverse factor has increased - pollution has increased. So, even though we have better treatments but the effect of that has been nullified or even superseded by the effect of the increase in pollution. This fact also explains increase in death rates observed.However, since the rate of deaths due to asthma has increased dramatically even in cities with long-standing, comprehensive medical records -This counters first reason that increase in death rates is because of more accurate recording. It says that deaths have increase dramatically even in cities which have had accurate recording from a long time. So, the first reason cannot explain the rise in deaths.and with little or no urban pollution, -This counters the second reason. If there is no pollution, then pollution cannot be the cause of increased deaths.one must instead conclude that the cause of increased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthma sufferers to relieve their symptoms. -This is the conclusion of the argument. It basically says that since the other two reasons cannot explain the increase in deaths, the reason is the use of bronchial inhalers.Each of the following, if true, provides support to the argument EXCEPT: -It means that we'll have four statements which will support the conclusion (do you remember the conclusion?!) and one statement which will not support the conclusion and this statement is the answer of this.Option Statement Analysis(A) Urban populations have doubled in the past decade. -Does this support the conclusion that the use of bronchial inhalers is the cause of increased death rates? The answer is No. I can only link this option statement with the second reason given about urban pollution, but the second reason has already been countered in the last statement of the passage, so this option statement is irrelevant and therefore, could be the correct option statement.(B) Records of asthma deaths are as accurate for the past twenty years as for the past ten years. -This option statement further counters Reason 1 and thereby supports the conclusion.(C) Evidence suggests that bronchial inhalers make the lungs more sensitive to irritation by airborne pollen. -This statement directly supports the conclusion.(D) By temporarily relieving the symptoms of asthma, inhalers encourage sufferers to avoid more beneficial measures. -This statement also supports the conclusion.(E) Ten years ago bronchial inhalers were not available as an asthma treatment. -This suggests that increase in deaths due to Asthma could be due to the introduction of bronchial inhalers. Therefore, this statement also supports the conclusion.As we can see, option A is the clear winner.To avoid making this post too lengthy, let me respond to the next question in the next post.Thanks,Chiranjeev_________________Free Trial:Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinarsCase studies:How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hoursMBA admits:M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]Learn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –Read our 2500+ reviewsSignature Read More Despite improvements in treatment for asthma, thedeath rate from this disease has doubled during the pastdecade from its previous rate.

I am relying on data that says that even in cities with no urban pollution, the death rate has risen dramatically. So, even if urban pollution doubled, it will not mean that urban pollution is the cause of increased deaths because I have already countered this in the argument. Therefore, this statement is not the required assumption.(B) Doctors and patients generally ignore the role of allergies in asthma. -Can you see what this option is doing? It is introducing one more factor which can explain the increased deaths. If we have one more possible cause, then our conclusion is weakened. We know that an assumption cannot weaken the conclusion; rather an assumption always supports the conclusion. Therefore, without further do, we can kick this option statement out.(C) Bronchial inhalers are unsafe, even when used according to the recommended instructions. -My first impression is that this statement supports the conclusion. However, is it absolutely necessary for the conclusion to hold true? The answer is No. Bronchial inhalers can be safe when used according to recommended instructions. Such a case won't break down the conclusion. Probably, they are safe when used according to the instructions but a large number of people don't use according to the instructions. So, we have a case where the negation of the statement and the conclusion both will hold true. Therefore, the statement is not absolutely required for the conclusion to hold true. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.(D) The use of bronchial inhalers aggravates other diseases that frequently occur among asthma sufferers and that often lead to fatal outcomes even when the asthma itself does not. -This statement, like option C, supports the conclusion; however, this statement also is not absolutely required for the conclusion to hold true.

Probably, the inhalers themselves are capable of causing deaths that they don't require help from other diseases  :wink: So, this option statement is also not required assumption and hence incorrect.(E) Increased urban pollution, improved recording of asthma deaths, and the use of bronchial inhalers are the only possible explanations of the increased death rate due to asthma. -This is the answer because we have already rejected four option statements and this is the last one, so we must select this. Just joking!To understand why this is required assumption, we need to look at how the conclusion was derived. The conclusion was derived by saying that since A and B are not the possible reason, C is the cause of increased deaths. Do you understand this? If not, look back at the passage analysis.So, we inherently assumed that only A, B and C are the reasons.

Let me know whether I'm wrong. bagdbmbaHi Chiranjeev,I'm not able to get it clearly...!As you've mentioned (rather as concluded) ""since A and B are not the possible reason, C is the cause of increased deaths.""..than how can we say that 'only three given reasons are possible' as A & B are already discarded by the author and that's why C comes up as the conclusion...Right?Please help!Hi,I don't really understand your query. I will still try to explain why option E is correct, but if the below explanation does not help, then please explain your doubt a bit more clearly.Suppose I give you the following argument:There are two possible explanations for Joe's success. One explanation is that he is super-smart. Other explanation is that he is very hard working. However, Tim is equally successful, but Tim is neither super-smart nor very hard working. Therefore, the actual reason for Joe's success is his ability to understand test maker's mindset.What is the assumption in this argument?The argument first tells two possible explanations, A and B, for Joe's success. But then, it says that there is Tim for whom neither explanation works.Then, the argument concludes that C is the actual explanation for Joe's success.In other words, the argument presents two explanations A and B for Joe's success and then, it indicates that these explanation could not explain Joe's success since they do not apply to Tim who is as successful as Joe. On the basis of this, the argument concludes that C is the reason for Joe's success.Now, the first question that should comes to mind on reading the argument is that why not D, E, F, G, H etc could be reasons for Joe's success. Why does the author not consider these other possible explanations?The reason is that the author assumes that only A, B, and C are possible explanations. So, when he sees that A and B cannot explain, he concludes that C is the reason.Now, if you understand till now, then you can see that the argument I have constructed is very much parallel to the given argument and the same reasoning applies to explain why option E is correct.bagdbmbaP.S:I actually chose D - as you've said ""this statement also is not absolutely required for the conclusion to hold true"" , I guess this sort of reasoning is pretty uncommon in GMAT CR... Let me know whether I'm wrong.I don't think this kind of reasoning is uncommon in GMAT CR. You do have strengtheners in assumptions questions in GMAT questions. These strengtheners strengthen the argument but are not absolutely required for the conclusion to hold true.Thanks,Chiranjeev_________________Free Trial:Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinarsCase studies:How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hoursMBA admits:M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]Learn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –Read our 2500+ reviewsSignature Read More Increased urban pollution, improved recording of asthma deaths - serve as counter premise in the argument.

Option C could be an inference, i.e. option C follows FROM the conclusion, not that it leads TO the conclusion. Despite improvements in treatment for asthma, thedeath rate from this disease has doubled during the pastdecade from its previous rate. Two possible explanationsfor this increase have been offered. First, the recording ofdeaths due to asthma has become more widespread andaccurate in the past decade than it had been previously.Second, there has been an increase in urban pollution.However, since the rate of deaths due to asthma hasincreased dramatically even in cities with long-standing,comprehensive medical records and with little or no urbanpollution, one must instead conclude that the cause ofincreased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthmasufferers to relieve their symptoms.Which one of the following is an assumption onwhich the argument depends?(A) Urban pollution has not doubled in the pastdecade.The premise clearly mentions that the pollution has changed for some cities but not for all the cities,But if we do negation test that the pollution has doubled even then the argument provides premise that the deaths due to asthma has increased in the cities where the the pollution has not increased.(B) Doctors and patients generally ignore the roleof allergies in asthma.This option is also discussed in the argument premise that the deaths happen even in the cities where the mediacal documentation is appropriate and the patients are aware of the problems.(C) Bronchial inhalers are unsafe, even when usedaccording to the recommended instructions.this does not make a assumption question since this is a clear conclusion and not leading to the conclusion.(D) The use of bronchial inhalers aggravates otherdiseases that frequently occur among asthmasufferers and that often lead to fatal outcomeseven when the asthma itself does not.The information provided in the option is clearly linking the premises and the conclusion of the argument and addresses why the bronchial inhalers are unsafe.but if we do the negation test that  bronchial inhalers does not aggravate other diseases.....,but this does not beark the argument as one can say that the inhalers might aggravate the issues related to asthma itself.(E) Increased urban pollution, improved recordingof asthma deaths, and the use of bronchialinhalers are the only possible explanations ofthe increased death rate due to asthma.Increased urban pollution ,improved records and use of bronchial inhalers are only possible explanations and if we negate this that the argument will be invalid since it then suggest that ther may be naother reason for the deaths..so this is the correct answer.

Absolutely! It may be that the inhalers have some totally different problem (maybe they're poisonous?? maybe they just don't work) unrelated to aggravating other diseases, and that the conclusion (inhalers > asthma) is true. Hence, D is not an assumption upon which the argument depends. Despite improvements in treatment for asthma, the death rate from this disease has doubled during the past decade from its previous rate. Two possible explanations for this increase have been offered. First, the recording of deaths due to asthma has become more widespread and accurate in the past decade than it had been previously. Second, there has been an increase in urban pollution. However, since the rate of deaths due to asthma has increased dramatically even in cities with long-standing, comprehensive medical records and with little or no urban pollution, one must instead conclude that the cause of increased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthma sufferers to relieve their symptoms.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?(A) Urban pollution has not doubled in the past decade. - WRONG.(B) Doctors and patients generally ignore the role of allergies in asthma. - WRONG.(C) Bronchial inhalers are unsafe, even when used according to the recommended instructions. - WRONG.(D) The use of bronchial inhalers aggravates other diseases that frequently occur among asthma sufferers and that often lead to fatal outcomes even when the asthma itself does not. - WRONG. Had the question stem asked for strengthener this would have been the answer in the sense that bronchial inhalers are the cause of increase. But it is not an absolute necessity.(E) Increased urban pollution, improved recording of asthma deaths, and the use of bronchial inhalers are the only possible explanations of the increased death rate due to asthma. - CORRECT.

But we don't need this to be the exact issue with inhalers -- there could be a million other reasons why inhalers are to blame for the deaths (e.g., perhaps someone is poisoning the inhalers, or perhaps people use inhalers improperly and die as a result). The argument doesn't absolutelyrequirethat the inhalers aggravate other diseases, so (D) is not an assumption on which the argument depends.Eliminate (D).Here's (E):Quote:(E) Increased urban pollution, improved recording of asthma deaths, and the use of bronchial inhalers are the only possible explanations of the increased death rate due to asthma.In the passage, the author rules out urban pollution and improved recording of asthma deaths as causes of the increased death rate.From this, he/she says that ""onemustinstead conclude that the cause of increased deaths is the use of bronchial inhalers by asthma sufferers to relieve their symptoms.""But what if there areotherthings that might be causing the increased death rate? Then one wouldn't HAVE to conclude that inhalers are the problem.So, to say that one MUST conclude that the inhalers are to blame, we MUST assume that there aren't any other potential explanations out there.That's why (E) is an assumption on which the argument depends.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More IMO E.It must be true for the conclusion to be properly drawnnakib77Despite improvements in treatment for asthma, the death rate from this disease has doubled during the past decade from its previous rate.

Since it then says that Europe isn't training enough people, we can say that Europe is not one of the ""most"" successful economies. So we can infer that to become one of the ""most"" successful, it would have to train more people.How can we say this is necessary for Europe to be ""more"" successful? I agree, we can't really infer this, but this answer stinks way less than the other four:(A) is totally out, it never compares engineers vs. researchers.(B) is out because all we know is that Japan is a model for this kind of training, so if anything it is a good comparison.(C) is incorrect because the stimulus never says whether Japan's economy is actually successful.(E) is totally out of scope; we have no clue how Europe stacks up to the competition.So (D) is the best of the bunch. broallThe most successful economies have been, and will continue to be, those that train as many people as possible in the human skills required to research, todevelop, and to apply new technology.

I spent more than 2 minutes on this one, since I wanted to be extra careful interpreting the language of the passage and answer choices, but I did go with (D) in the end. P2 - Yes, Japancanbecome more successful economically bytrainingpeople, but we do not know that this success has actually happened (more on this in P4); P3 - Yes, and your read fits (D) perfectly; P4 - Almost. I think you are reading into the language too much. To cobble together the first two sentences, the passage states thatJapan is a model for this sort of trainingeffort, with an aim totrain as many people as possible in the human skills required to research, to develop, and to apply new technology. Because the passage mentions only efforts or goals, the economic success of Japan or any other country depends upon the same factors:training as many people as possible...In other words, Japan seems to be doing a better job, via training its people, than many European economies inpositioningitself for economic success, but we cannot deduce that its current workforce consists ofan uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor. The passage simply does not delve so deep.To be honest, you could swap outEuropein choice (D) with any other country/continent, even Japan, and still have an accurate statement. Sentence 1 makes it clear that the more people there are who are trained in certain skills, the more successful that economy will be. In layman's terms, the more, the merrier, Japan included.To get better at inference questions, just treat them as any other type of question. Youmustfind an anchor in the text to back up the answer choice, or it is incorrect. Stick to the surface: take the information at face value. When you start to conjure upwhat ifsand various interpretations, you should definitely pull back and reexamine the passage.

Because the passage mentions only efforts or goals, the economic success of Japan or any other country depends upon the same factors:training as many people as possible...In other words, Japan seems to be doing a better job, via training its people, than many European economies inpositioningitself for economic success, but we cannot deduce that its current workforce consists ofan uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor. The passage simply does not delve so deep.To be honest, you could swap outEuropein choice (D) with any other country/continent, even Japan, and still have an accurate statement. Sentence 1 makes it clear that the more people there are who are trained in certain skills, the more successful that economy will be. In layman's terms, the more, the merrier, Japan included.To get better at inference questions, just treat them as any other type of question. Youmustfind an anchor in the text to back up the answer choice, or it is incorrect. Stick to the surface: take the information at face value. When you start to conjure upwhat ifsand various interpretations, you should definitely pull back and reexamine the passage. You will likely find that your answer is hiding right in plain sight.- AndrewHi Andrew,MentorTutoring- First of all, thanks for taking out time and for the detailed explanation.I was thinking about it in a different perspective as well later yesterday.(C) Japan’s successful economy depends upon an uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor.The statement says ""Japan's economydepends uponnarrow base of skilled labor"" - Can I say that this statement is saying that without ""uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor"" Japan's economy won't be successful? I mean this inference from option C would likely make me eliminate this option. Because then this statement turns need of skilled labor into a necessary condition for Japan's economy to be successful whereas the original argument says to be the most successful economy you need a skilled labor to train others.What I mean that Japan's economy can still be successful without these skilled labor but may be not the most successful economy.Is my understanding or inference from option C correct? shameekv1989Hi Andrew,MentorTutoring- First of all, thanks for taking out time and for the detailed explanation.I was thinking about it in a different perspective as well later yesterday.(C) Japan’s successful economy depends upon an uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor.The statement says ""Japan's economydepends uponnarrow base of skilled labor"" - Can I say that this statement is saying that without ""uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor"" Japan's economy won't be successful?

Yes, your assessment of option (C) above is accurate. According to the passage, Japan, like any other country, needs to train people in certain skills to create a more successful economy, plain and simple. It is not a matter of comparison, really. Option (C) sounds alluring, but by pigeonholing the information, if you can manage to unravel it, the answer works against itself. Thisuncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labordoes not come from the passage, but from a reinterpretation of the information thatisprovided.- Andrew_________________I am no longer contributing to GMAT Club.

Japan is a model for this sort of training effort. Europe as a whole is in a weaker position: there is a shortage of skilled labor trained to use the new technologies, and there are not enough scientists able to develop and apply the technology. However, even in Japan there is a shortage of technically qualified people, and, like most European countries, Japan has far too many workers qualified to perform only menial tasks.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) There is a greater worldwide shortage of research scientists than there is of engineers.(B) Japan is not the best country against which to measure a country???s economic success.(C) Japan???s successful economy depends upon an uncommonly narrow base of highly skilled labor.(D) To be economically more successful, Europe needs to train more people in the new technologies.(E) European countries have economies that are more successful than those of most other countries.By POE, I reached B. Here's my analysis1.For option D- I am not convinced as to how we can say that there is a causation between getting successful and training more people. All we can infer is that - most successful economies are doing something. We cannot infer that it's those ""something"" that is making them successful. for ex: the most successful agrarian economies export rice, but that doesn't mean that to become a successful agrarian economy, one needs to export rice.2.For option C- It says that Japan's successful economy depends on X. We don't know if the success is dependent on X. We can very well assume that there could be other aspects that are contributing to the success. Again no causation can be inferred with certainty.3.For Option B- It says that Japan is not the best. That we can say for sure because we know Japan is one of the most successful economies and Japan has limitations. Japan could be 2nd best, 3rd best, or anything else but definitely not the ""best"" as we say in the optionPlease let me know if my analysis makes sense. Thank you.AndrewN- May I request your help? please and thank you.

May be true may be not but more importantly it is not going along with the core of the passage flow. Japan is merely an example in the passage and an example can't be the centre point of a passage.(C) Japan’s successful economy depends upon anuncommonlynarrow base of highly skilled labor. - WRONG. Adverbs are red flags and here it is one. Without that the choice looks more enticing for me. Why use an adverb that modifies the choice unnecessarily in direction not relevant to the flow of the passage. More so that Japan is used as an example in the passage.(D) To be economically more successful,Europe needs to train more peoplein the new technologies. - CORRECT. Took too long to answer this one but happy that i chose this after getting stuck with B and C also along with this.(E) European countries have economies that aremore successful thanthose of most other countries. - WRONG.

Typically, to solve such questions, you need to show that a suppressed premise is not likely to be true. The assumption of the argument is that before shoddy scientific work can do harm it will be exposed by the work of other scientists. Look at choice (A).

The paragraph doesn't talk about Large seeds not being produced so this is still an unknown and could be assumed. Correct(C) In rainy periods, the small finches gather enough food to grow much larger and heavier, but their ultimate size is limited bytheir inability to eat small seeds fast.Out of context.

Ummmmm what? This argument is kind of like the following: Subway chicken sandwiches are necessary for human survival. During the summer, we all eat lots of Subway chicken sandwich and everything is awesome and plenty of people make it through the summer. However, during the winter, Subway sells turkey sandwiches. Therefore, more people die. The assumption in these arguments is something like ""when the rain produces these small seeds, there are less large, hard seeds."" The argument is assuming that more of one thing means less of the other.(A)	Out of scope. All we need to know here is that during droughts there are enough hard seeds to go around for all the finches. It doesn't really matter what else there is because the finches are doing fine during droughts.(B)	Correct. If more rain = less large hard seeds, then we can clearly see how this would be detrimental to the finch's survival. If we negate this and say that ""rainy weather does NOT result in fewer large, hard, seeds"" then this would mean that there doesn't seem to be as much of a relationship between climate and survival as people think(C)	Out of scope. In the argument, we are talking about survival and not about size. This seems like a trap answer for someone that was running out of time and saw ""population SIZE of finch species) and went with it.(D)	Not necessary. We don't need to assume that there was as much of one kind of weather as the other. We are talking about what happens during those kinds of weather. It doesn't matter if that type of weather is any more or less frequent then the other type.(E)	Out of scope. We don't care if the seeds have to or don't have to be cracked open. The seeds are important not because of their ""crackability"" but because of their type and how available they are to these finches. There does not seem to be any correlation between ""crackability"" and survival goal-climatic  variations cause a major difference in survival rates of small and large finchesplan/prethinkdrought period-more members of large F survive-					due to large ,hard seedsrainy season-less members of large   F survive-					due to small seeds growing in moisturegap-unstated premise or bridge the gap in the argumentrainy season contains small seedsunstated-large seeds- rain seasonhence we can understand,,raiy season contains no much  large seeds which are feed to large F species Hi Experts,""In rainy years, fewer members of the large finch species survive because the additional moisture fosters the growth of plants that produce small seeds""Do we have to find an assumption in the reasoning of the above statement?My thinking is that since this statement is a fact, we shouldn't question it's validity.Infact, we should consider the reasoning of this fact as true (without questioning it) and then see if the conclusion i.e. ""There is a def relationship bw climate and population size of finch species"" has been derived correctly based on this fact, without any assumptions.Is my thinking correct?

X-this is completely anti-thetical to what the passage says...during droughs, larger seeds NOT smaller seeds are made(B) A lengthy period of rainy weather results in fewer large, hard seeds being produced.CORRECT. This has to be true, otherwise the birds with larger beaks would still be able to survive and the differences in survival rates would diminish.(C) In rainy periods, the small finches gather enough food to grow much larger and heavier, but their ultimate size is limited by their inability to eat small seeds fast. X-OK, but we already kind of knew this from the passage.(D) The Galapagos climate during this fourteen year period had aboutas muchdry weather as it had wet weather. X-we don't care so much about the relative spits in dry vs wet weather...irrelevant(E) Small seedsdo not haveto be cracked open in order to be digested by any of the finch varieties. X-this weakens the argument b/c large birds would then be able to eat these smaller seeds and survive Laksh47You're right--we don't want to question any of the premises of the argument. We have to accept that the rainy weather encourages the growth of plants with small seeds. We just don't know whether that hurts the birds that eat large seeds, because we don't know that one kind of plant growsat the expenseof the other. If we can have more small-seed plants without losing large-seed plants, then the argument is much less compelling._________________Dmitry Farber | Manhattan Prep GMAT Instructor | San DiegoManhattan GMAT Discount|Manhattan GMAT Course Reviews|View Instructor ProfileSignature Read More The argument concludes that climatic differences are the reason for survival of different sized finches in different seasons. As support for this conclusion, it offers different diet during different climates as reason.The question stem asks us for assumption for the above argument.(A) During drought conditions, the weather promotes the growth of plants that produce small, hard seeds. -- Close choice. But if we read closely, it actually weakens the conclusion. If during drought conditions the weather promotes the growth of plants that produce small, hard seeds, then the small finches should logically be able to survive. So is there any other reason? We don't know. An assumption should strengthen the already provided logical reasoning of the argument (climatic changes ----> effect on survival). Eliminate. (I kept this until the last)(B) A lengthy period of rainy weather results in fewer large, hard seeds being produced. -- Correct. This explains that the differing food available in different weathers is directly the result of climatic changes. And since the larger finches are unable to eat the small seeds quick enough, they perish in the rainy season. This assumption choice eliminates a potential weakener, which would have argued that food sources (because of which apparently the finches of different size survive) is not the result of climatic changes but something else.(C) In rainy periods, the small finches gather enough food to grow much larger and heavier, but their ultimate size is limited by their inability to eat small seeds fast. -- I didn't understand this choice frankly. But it seems too tangential to the argument. We need to focus on strengthening the argument through finding the missing link or through eliminating a potential weakener.(D) The Galapagos climate during this fourteen year period had about as much dry weather as it had wet weather. -- Irrelevant to the argument. Eliminate.(E) Small seeds do not have to be cracked open in order to be digested by any of the finch varieties. -- Eliminate. ""Small, hard seeds"" is the phrase used. Not relevant to the argument. it's an assumed to conclude the argument questionB) if you negate B then there will be large hard seeds in the rainy weather and large flinches will feed on them and thus survive making conclusion weak GMATNinjaDmitryFarberWhile I understand why all the other options are wrong, I still need some clarification for option B. The word ""lengthy period"" can lead to a mild scope shift, thereby making the statement not exactly function as an assumption. Let me explain:The negation of the statement would read, ""Alengthy periodof rainy weather results inequal or morelarge, hard seeds being produced"". This may not be the case when the rainy seasons aren't lengthy or are normal, where the reported correlation still may be holding true.Secondly, there is no guarantee that ""the lengthy period"" would be short enough for the existing large finches to stay alive. Maybe they died by then.Can you please explain what I am missing? I can try explaining further if the argument isn't clear enough.

Agreed with you that C makes the assumption stronger by stating that they are willing to sacrifice lose in sales just because it's not morally accepted by the advertisers. But also remember that they are also ""motivated by [moral] as well asfinancial considerations"". The last sentence mentions that they care morally. How about the ""financial considerations""? C would literally says that they give zero care about financial, which omit the ""financial considerations"" part! In my opinion, the argument is - "" There is evidence, however, that some advertisers are motivated by moral as well as financial considerations"" .

We are asked to find the suppressed premised, or assumption, of the argument. Finding the suppressed premise, of an argument can be difficult. However, on the LSAT you have an advantage—the suppressed premise is listed as one of the five answer-choices. To test whether an answer-choice is a suppressed premise, ask yourself whether it would make the argument more plausible. If so, then it is very likely a suppressed premise.The argument states that resources have supposedly been diverted from writing speeding tickets to combating the drug problem and yet the same number of speeding tickets are still being written. It then concludes the resources were in fact not diverted to fighting drug-related crime. The link that allows this conclusion to be drawn is the assumption that if resources were diverted to drug enforcement, then fewer speeding tickets would have been written.The answer is (E)._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More FistailMore than a year ago, the city announced that police would crack down on illegally parked cars and that resources would be diverted from writing speeding tickets to ticketing illegally parked cars.

Therefore, the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime simply is not true.Conclusion: The excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime simply is not true.Premise:Police chief has (say 100) policemen to ticket people who speed cars.Earlier, city decided to divert above policemen to ticket people who illegally park their cars.However, recent happenings do not show any evidence of people ticketed for illegally parking their cars.The Police chef now defends his men: Drug abuse are on rise, so I had to divert my men to combat it.The people are smarter, they say: Oh if these 100 people were diverted to stop drugs abuse, how come the number of people caught for speeding cars HAVE NOT decreased. So you are showing up an excuse to not issue tickets to people who park their cars illegally.Quote:(A) every member of the police force is qualified to work on combating the city’s drug problem(B) drug-related crime is not as serious a problem for the city as the police chief claims it isCompletely out of scope, qualification of force and seriousness of issue at hand is now way relatedto the argument.Quote:(C) writing speeding tickets should be as important a priority for the city as combating drug-related crimeI form a bad habit discard options withshould.Reason: An assumption MUST BE TRUE. No one is asking the author's opinion.Quote:(D) the police could be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem without having to reduce writing speeding ticketsDo we negate main verb of the sentence? Please advise on below negation and its effect on conclusion;Option 1:the police could NOT be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem without having to reduce writing speeding ticketsOption 2:the police could be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem while simultaneously having to reduce writing speeding ticketsQuote:(E) the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crimePresenting two negated versions:the police can continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crime.But above defeats my evidence itself, which says: no of speeding tickets are the same.An assumption is about finding a missing link of evidence, not destroying the evidence itself.the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while not diverting resources to combating drug-related crimeI found it a complex to review for an effect on the conclusion. FistailMore than a year ago, the city announced that police would crack down on illegally parked cars and that resources would be diverted from writing speeding tickets to ticketing illegally parked cars. But no crackdown has taken place. The police chief claims that resources have had to be diverted from writing speeding tickets to combating the city’s staggering drug problem. Yet the police are still writing as many speeding tickets as ever. Therefore, the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime simply is not true.The conclusion in the passage depends on the assumption that(A) every member of the police force is qualified to work on combating the city’s drug problem(B) drug-related crime is not as serious a problem for the city as the police chief claims it is(C) writing speeding tickets should be as important a priority for the city as combating drug-related crime(D) the police could be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem without having to reduce writing speeding tickets(E) the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crimeSource: LSATPremises:City announced that police would divert resources from writing speeding tickets to ticketing illegally parked cars.But no crackdown has taken place.The police claims that resources have had to be diverted from writing speeding tickets to combating the city’s staggering drug problem.Yet the police are still writing as many speeding tickets as ever.ConclusionTherefore, the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime simply is not true.The author is concluding that the police are not engaged in drug-related crime simply because the number of speeding tickets are same as before.The author is assuming that it is not possible to issue same number of speeding tickets after diverting resources. (but it may not be so - the police could employ more effective strategies of issues speeding tickets needing fewer officers)(A) every member of the police force is qualified to work on combating the city’s drug problemIrrelevant. It doesn't matter whether EVERY member is qualified to combat drug problem or not.(B) drug-related crime is not as serious a problem for the city as the police chief claims it isIrrelevant. We are not judging whether he resources should be diverted to drug problem.(C) writing speeding tickets should be as important a priority for the city as combating drug-related crimeIrrelevant. Again, we are not judging the relative importance of various problems.(D) the police could be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem without having to reduce writing speeding ticketsThe premises tell us that illegally parked car problem is not being combated. Since this runs against the given premise, it can obviously not be something the author assumes i.e. it can't be a missing premise.(E) the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crimeNegation - the police CAN continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crimeIf the police can continue writing as many tickets as before (by being more effective) after diverting resources, our conclusion falls.

FactBut no crackdown has taken place. ""But"" introduces a contrast. Fact.The police chief claims that resources have had to be diverted from writing speeding tickets to combating the city’s staggering drug problem. Claim/PremiseYet the police are still writing as many speeding tickets as ever. - ""yet"" introduces a contrast from the previous statement.Therefore, the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime simply is not true. - Conclusion. Aligned with the contrast and against what the Police chief claimed.Option Elimination. - we need to find the minimum condition or the missing premise or the assumption for the conclusion to hold: the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime is not true. What if the police could deploy cameras/technology or new strategies and write as many or even more tickets while deploying resources to solve drug-related issues? The basic assumption of the author is that the police can't do both at the same time, and this is what option E highlights.(A) every member of the police force is qualified to work on combating the city’s drug problem - ""qualification"" is out of the scope of the argument, which is to find the missing premise for the conclusion to hold: the excuse about resources being tied up in fighting drug-related crime is not true.(B) drug-related crime is not as serious a problem for the city as the police chief claims it is - judging the police chief's claim is out of scope.(C) writing speeding tickets should be as important a priority for the city as combating drug-related crime - We are looking for an assumption. Right? What is an assumption? A missing premise or fact? What is this statement? ""should be""? Is it an opinion? Can this be an assumption? No. Moreover, at best, from the argument, it seems that drug-related crime is a priority, and this option is trying to establish equal importance for speeding tickets as well, which is out of scope.(D) the police could be cracking down on illegally parked cars and combating the drug problem without having to reduce writing speeding tickets - First, the ""illegally parked cars"" are not part of the conclusion and scope of our argument here. Secondly, even if we take the drugs part, it says that police can do both, which directly weakens the conclusion. The assumption, when negated, weakens the conclusion, but not without negating. All assumptions are strengths (while all strengthened can't be assumptions as assumptions that ""must be true"" or a necessary condition). Opposite of what we need.(E) the police cannot continue writing as many speeding tickets as ever while diverting resources to combating drug-related crime - ok. When we negate it, the negated option will shatter the conclusion.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/more-than-a-year-ago-the-city-announced-that-police-would-52247.html

I hope this is of some benefit to my fellow GMATWarriors.______________________________________________The “suicide wave” that followed the United States stock market crash of October 1929 is more legend than fact. Careful examination of the monthly figures on the causes of death in 1929 shows that the number of suicides in October and in November was comparatively low. In only three other months were the monthly figures lower. During the summer months, when the stock market was flourishing, the number of suicides was substantially higher.Which one of the following, if true, would best challenge the conclusion of the passage?Pre-thinking the answer:The conclusion is that the suicide wave following the US stock crash of OCT 1929 is more legend than fact. The main premises are that OCT and NOV 1929 have low suicide ratesrelativeto the rest of that year's month's, with the exception of three other months. If I am to challenge the conclusion, I need to demonstrate that the suicide wave is high relative to some other factor such as previous years' Octobers and Novembers. If I can show, for example, that the suicide rate for the months of October and November in the years 1920-1928 were far lower than those for October and November of 1929, I could sufficiently show that there actually was an increase in suicides in October and November of 1929, thereby challenging the conclusion that the suicide wave was practically a non-event.(A) The suicide rate is influenced by many psychological, interpersonal, and societal factors during any given historical period.Incorrect- While true, it is unhelpful in challenging the question as it lacks any sort of evidence to suggest that the particular months of October and November in 1929 actually had a relatively high suicide rate. Remember, we need to identify something very particular in order to challenge the conclusion. This answer choice is far too broad.(B) October and November have almost always had relatively high suicide rates, even during the 1920s and 1930s.Incorrect- This actually solidifies the stimulus's conclusion. This answer choice basically states that there was practically no change in the relative suicide rate for the months of October and November. We need to state the precise polar opposite (not to be confused with logical opposite).(C) The suicide rate in October and November of 1929 was considerably higher than the average for those months during several preceding and following years.Correct- Let's say that, for the years 1920-1928, there are an average of 100 suicides every July verses an average of 15 and 10 for the months of October and November, respectively. So if in October and November of 1929 there is an average suicide rate of 60 and 40, respectively, the average for the months of October and November are still relatively low in comparison to July's 100 suicides. If, however, all Octobers and Novembers for the years 1920-1928 had only 10 suicides each per year, but in 1929 had 60 and 40, respectively, then we suddenly see that the suicide wave was in fact something far beyond the typical. That is precisely what this answer choice does for us, and, thus, it is the correct answer choice. Choice C demonstrates that the suicide rate is in fact relatively high because the October and November average was far higher relative to those months during the several preceding and following years.(D) During the years surrounding the stock market crash, suicide rates were typically lower at the beginning of any calendar year than toward the end of that year.Incorrect- Again, this actually supports the conclusion of the stimulus rather than challenge it.(E) Because of seasonal differences, the number of suicides in October and November of 1929 would not be expected to be the same as those for othermonths.Incorrect- This does not speak to the relative frequency that we are hoping to challenge. This answer choice is therefore irrelevant for our purposes.____________________________I'm not sure that this question should be labeled as 700.

Perhaps the yearly average perhaps not. we need to read further to understand this.In only three other months were the monthly figures lowerWhatever this average was, we know that in total only 5 months fall below the average.During the summer months, when the stock market was flourishing, the number of suicides was substantially higher.Author uses this fact deduce that there must be some reason of suicides other than stock market crash, a the no of suicides were more when the stock was still flourishing.I like the answer choices in this question, they are spread wide apart in terms of reasoning.(A) The suicide rate is influenced by many psychological, interpersonal, and societal factors during any given historical period.This lists factors which influence the suicide rate. I was not able to make out if this actually weakens the conclusion, so kept it as a contender.(B) October and November have almost always had relatively high suicide rates, even during the 1920s and 1930s.Strengthens the conclusion. drop it.(C) The suicide rate in October and November of 1929 was considerably higher than the average for those months during several preceding and following years.This somewhat hints at our confusion, that the actual suicide in the preceding years was much less and it actually rose in October and November. Solid reasoning to prove author wrong. Keep it.(D) During the years surrounding the stock market crash, suicide rates were typically lower at the beginning of any calendar year than toward the end of that year.but we dont know what happens in the middle of the year. this choice neither weakens nor strengthens. Drop it.(E) Because of seasonal differences, the number of suicides in October and November of 1929 would not be expected to be the same as those for other months.ok. so what should we expect ? to increase or decrease ? No answer. Drop it.So we are left it 2 contenders.

The correct answer choice is (C)In this stimulus, the author provides limited information from which an overly broad conclusion (that ""the suicide wave... is more legend than fact"") is drawn. The author compares the number of suicides after the crash to those from the previous summer, when the stock market was flourishing. Because the number of suicides after the crash was actually lower than it had been during the previous summer, the author concludes that the stock market crash did not in fact lead people to suicide.The problem is that the information provided gives us only a small piece of the puzzle. For example, if suicides in winter are less common than suicides in summer, then the author's conclusion may not be valid. For a more accurate assessment, we may wish to compare the suicide figures of October 1929 to those of previous Octobers.Answer choice (A): The many factors that affect the suicide rate in general are irrelevant to the author's question of whether the crash of '29 caused an increase in suicides.Answer choice (B): This choice strengthens the argument: If we could normally expect to see high suicide rates during October, then the fact that the rates of October 1929 were lower than those of the preceding summer suggests that the author may be right.Answer choice (C): This is the correct answer choice. If during the weeks following the crash there were many more suicides than we might normally expect to see during that time of the year, then this weakens the argument by making it more likely that some of those suicides were attributable to the crash.Answer choice (D): Like incorrect answer choice (B) above, this answer choice strengthens the argument, because it would lead us to expect rates in October to be higher—not lower—than those of the preceding summer.Answer choice (E): Without specifics, the mere fact that we should expect to see some seasonal variation in suicide rates has no effect on the author's argument. Should we normally expect higher rates in October than in the summer, or lower? The information provided in this answer choice provides no insight into the credibility of the author's argument. gurpreet07The “suicide wave” that followed the United States stock market crash of October 1929 is more legend than fact.

Doesn't this statement now weaken the author's conclusion? Because if increasing actual flying time doesn't help reduce the crashes, there is no point on rethinking their approach. And if negating a choice -> Weakens the argument, it is the right choice.I did choose D but I struggled to eliminate C. I tried to apply the Assumption Negation technique but that didn't help me. Perhaps I am not applying it the right away.AjiteshArun, Could you please advise on this?You're thinking along the right lines. Let's look at the information we have in terms of whether the presence or absence of something leads to a ""sure win"" or a ""sure loss"".Let's say that a Formula 1 team is training its drivers to win an upcoming race. The drivers' training includes two things: physical (X) and mental (Y) conditioning. However, someone then says that these two things (X and Y) cannot compensate for actual time spent driving F1 cars (Z). They then conclude that the training program needs to be reworked. The argument stops here, without getting into whether the training program will actually make the drivers win.Now, when we say that X and Y cannot compensate for Z, we mean thatZ cannot be left out. However, that doesn't mean that the presence of Z will be sufficient to guarantee a win. In other words, ~ the absence of Z will lead to a ""sure loss"", but the presence of Z does not lead to a ""sure win"".Back to the question. You negated C correctly:The number of airline crashes willnotdecrease if pilot training programs focus on increasing actual flying time.However, this doesn't necessarily weaken the author's conclusion that ~ the existing training program is insufficient and that it needs to be reworked. That is, saying that Z cannot guarantee an outcome doesn'tnecessarilymean that Z is not part of the solution.Let's take a look at the negated version of D:Lack of actual flying time isnotan important contributor to pilot error in commercial plane crashes.This is great, because it isdirectlytelling us that Z is not part of the solution. Now we know that the author is wrong, and we can leave the training program as it is._________________Free Comprehensive CR Course: youtube.com/@DelvAcademy/playlistsSignature Read More I believe it is (D).

So negating C does not hold up the conclusion. OA is D. This the answer from Ron expertthis is a good use of the reversal method for (d).the problem with (c) is that it implies that increasing the flying hours, all by itself, WILL decrease the number of crashes.this definitely isn't necessary to the argument (which strongly suggests that a decrease in crashes will come from a combination of extra flying hours + other mentioned factors, such as ""classroom instruction"" and ""emphasizing communication skills in the cockpit"")._________________CR: Focus of the Week: Must be True QuestionSignature Read More (A) Training programs can eliminate pilot errors. -It is already stated in the argument.

Given the stimulus, are we sure, if this taught, it will decrease number of crashes. Think of it this way --- if you learned driving, good hands on, are you sure there will not be any crashes.

No argument.But author thinks otherwise that crashes will not reduce.WHY?Because author thinks lack of actual flying is important parameter in affecting the number of commercial plane crashes.(C) The number of airline crashes will decrease if pilot training programs focus on increasing actual flying time.So till this point I know that lack of actual flying is important parameter in affecting the number of commercial plane crashes.But Can I be sure that if flying time in training for pilots is increased then number of plane crashes will definitely decrease.No.One possibility - May be even if the flying time is increased still it needs adequate associated classroom training to be effective for pilots......So let's say it's the balanced combination of classroom training and flying training that will be effective in reducing number of plane crashes.But because only classroom training is being implemented then authors argument holds.

This knocks C out as a correct answer choice.Further, C speaks in absolute language: the crashes ""will"" decrease. However, our premises and conclusion in the stem are somewhat softer than that. It isn't necessary to the author's limited conclusion that the ""airlines should rethink their approach"" that we absolutely know that taking a particular measure WILL definitely have the desired result._________________my journeyhttps://gmatclub.com/forum/2-years-i-think-waste-my-time-306978.html#p2403268Signature Read More anandnkI believe it is (D).

The correct answer choice is (D)The final sentence of the stimulus is the conclusion. This conclusion relies on the premise that increased classroom instruction and greater emphasis on cockpit communication (the airlines’ training approach) can not compensate for a lack of actual flying time in diminishing pilot error. But what do we know about a lack of flying time? How do we know it’s important to compensate for a lack of actual flying time? Look for an answer that protects the idea of actual flying time being essential to the lessening of pilot error.Answer Choice (A): This straightforward answer appears tempting at first. By suggesting an alternative approach (one that addresses lack of actual flying time over classroom instruction and communication skills) to the problem, one might assume that the author must hold that there is a training program that can eliminate pilot error. The goal, however, is not total elimination of pilot error, but simply addressing the problem (and presumably minimizing it). Negate the answer and ask, “How would the author respond to this?” The author might reply that the currently proposed plan cuts pilot error by 55%, but one addressing lack of actual flying time might do so by 99%. Neither program eliminates pilot error, but the argument remains potentially valid.Answer Choice (B): Whether or not commercial airline pilots routinely undergo additional training throughout their careers is irrelevant to the original argument. If we negate the statement to read “commercial pilots do not routinely undergo additional training throughout their careers” the argument’s conclusion remains intact as it is only concerned with the airlines rethinking their approach because it does not address a lack of flying time.Answer Choice (C): Though also an attractive answer choice, the author concludes only that the airlines should rethink their strategy, as classroom instruction and an increased emphasis on communication can not compensate for lack of actual flying time. The author does not hold that an increase in actual flying time will have any effect (in fact, an increase in flying time is not mentioned), only that the specific plan proposed by the airlines does not adequately compensate for the lack of actual flying time.Answer Choice (D): This is the correct answer choice. The stimulus explicitly states that the airlines should rethink their training approach as it is unrealistic to expect their proposed measures to compensate for actual lack of flying time. If lack of flying time is in fact an important contributor to pilot error in commercial plane crashes (the problem the airlines are attempting to remedy), training approaches that do not adequately address this important contributor are inadequate and should be rethought.Answer Choice (E): The author does not assume that communication skills are not important to pilot training programs, only that they can not compensate for a lack of actual flying time. Hi everyone,How do the airlines expect to prevent commercial plane crashes? Studies have shown that pilot error contributes to two-thirds of all such crashes. To address this problem, the airlines have upgraded their training programs by increasing the hours of classroom instruction and emphasizing communication skills in the cockpit. But it is unrealistic to expect such measures to compensate for pilots' lack of actual flying time. Therefore, the airlines should rethink their training approach to reducing commercial crashes.Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the argument depends?Pre-thinking:The author believes strongly that the lack of flying time is an important factor.Let's negate this statement-> lack of actual flying time is not an important factor in decreasing the pilot's errors during a commercial flight. Then the argument breaks since it is through the lack of flying time that the author draws her conclusion(A) Training programs can eliminate pilot errors.The argument is concerned with decreasing the pilot's errors. Hence incorrect(B) Commercial pilots routinely undergo additional training throughout their careers.We are talking about increasing the training hours so even if there is not usually additional training throughout the pilot's career it does no impact the argument at all. Hence incorrect(C) The number of airline crashes will decrease if pilot training programs focus on increasing actual flying time.Wrong entity. We are talking about commercial planes' crashes not normal airline crashes. Hence incorrect(D) Lack of actual flying time is an important contributor to pilot error in commercial plane crashes.In line with pre-thinking. Hence correct(E) Communication skills are not important to pilot training programs.Not necessarily. They might be important but they might not be as important as flying time as for reducing # of crashes. Hence incorrect",https://gmatclub.com/forum/how-do-the-airlines-expect-to-prevent-commercial-plane-50802.html

What is that claim? that odds against obtaining a match by chance alone are astronomical. Say, the odds are something like a 1 in a billion that the DNA fingerprint of one person will match the DNA fingerprint of another person.You have to weaken this claim. The author tells you that the odds were calculated assuming that the different characteristics in a pattern are independent. Think of a password. If you have to write a 10 letter password using only letters of the alphabet, there are 26*26*26.....26 = (26)^10 different ways in which you can write it. The odds against two people creating the same password are very high. You are assuming here that each letter is independent of the other 9 letters. What if that is not the case? Say, your password must have at least 2 of the 5 vowels. You have created restrictions. Each letter is not independent of the other letters now. The number of passwords you can create now is significantly lower.Option (C) tells you that some groups share the same characteristics i.e. of the 10 letters, 5 letters are identical in each password of this group. Now, the chances of getting the same password have increased significantly. This weakens the claim that the odds against finding a match are very high.The only other option you could get stuck in is (A) The large amount of genetic material that people share with all other people and with other animals is not included in the DNA fingerprinting procedure.This just tells you that the features that people share are not a part of fingerprinting procedure. This is like telling you that the passwords actually have 15 letters but the first 5 letters are the same for everyone. Basically, it doesn't change our odds at all. We anyway did not include the common part in our calculation. Hence, this option does not weaken the claim._________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More We need to find a fact which weakens the claim that DNA fingerprinting is foolproof. It is also mentioned that 'These odds are based on an assumption that there is independence between the different characteristics represented by a single pattern.'(C) In the whole population there are various different subgroups, within each of which certain sets of geneticcharacteristics are shared.This information clearly weaken the claim. As different subgroups may share the same genetic characteristics, the assumption on which the claim is based is proved wrong. First POE is not too bad. IMO you should look at all answers to see that there is no ""better"" answer, so you can POE while you do that. A better answer is an answer that attack directly the conclusion (in weaken question like this) and adds less ""out of scope"" data as possible.When I looked at this question I immediately canceled A,B & D as IMO they are too far from the data given in the question or simply irrelevant.When I looked at E it seemed to attack less directly the  ""independence between the different characteristics represented by a single pattern"" than C did.  so I was left with C.Hope that helps.. Out of the 5 choices only A and E are relevant to the premises provided in the stimulus.Option A strengthens or supports the proponents by discounting the common genetic material shared.Option C is exactly the opposite of option A and it weakens the argument presented in the stimulus.And I agree, POE is the best technique here. I thought in A, the answer means that some parts of the DNA is not tested, and therefore it's most likely to cause mistakes. FQI thought in A, the answer means that some parts of the DNA is not tested, and therefore it's most likely to cause mistakes.Option A talks of some parts which is shared across diverse groups and hence including it in the DNA analysis will skew the result. Hence option A should be ruled out.The idea is to cut out the common portion and retain the uniqueness of the DNA fingerprint to uniquely identify the individual.Side note: I have heard that comparing at least 6 different areas of the DNA strands or sequences, the chances of these 6 areas matching for any two individual is simply out of the question since the chances are less than 1 in 6 billion.Completely irrelevant to the current context but nevertheless interesting bits of information. Used POE to eliminate B, D & E since they are irrelevantAssumption is based on the fact that there is independence between the different characteristics represented by a single pattern. Therefore, anything that suggests that there is no independence between the different characteristics will weaken this assumption. Between A & C, A talks about the material that is shared and is not included in the fingerprinting procedure. Not much help. However, C talks about the fact that different subgroups share certain genetic characteristics.

Thanks.We want an answer choice that gives a reason why the assumption that ""independence between different characteristics"" in a single pattern does NOT mean it's unlikely to get a match by mere chance. If this seems too complicated, we can just think of it as: we want a reason why the DNA of a suspect and the DNA found at a crime scene could match up due to chance, not because it's the actual culprit's DNA. (C) offers the possibility that people in subgroups share the same genetic characteristics that show up in the patterns.(A) perhaps strengthens the argument. If we're worried about seeing patterns because we all largely have the same genes, (A) eliminates this possibility.(B) is out of scope. We aren't concerned with theories of interpretation but the odds of a mistake. If anything, (B) may actually strengthen the argument--we're all pretty confident in the best way of interpreting, so if there's a mistaken match, we'll catch it!(D) the skill required is not extraordinary? That's good, that means they can be low skilled and still do the job! Regardless, this is out of scope. It doesn't address the link between the patterns and the accuracy.(E) is irrelevant. Great, they've helped with disease research. What does this have to do with odds? This is a bit of a wordy passage, particularly the second sentence. Essentially what proponents of DNA fingerprinting are saying is that the results obtained from the biochemical procedure are valid and that chance can be ruled out.We need a weakener that attack the idea that a person's generic material can be used to reliably match a suspect's genetic material against that of a specimen from the crime scene.“DNA fingerprinting” is a recently-introduced biochemical procedure that uses a pattern derived from a person’s genetic material to match a suspect’s genetic material against that of a specimen from a crime scene.

Does this necessarily mean that the quality of the child care programs will improve.  Perhaps in a magical fairyland, anything at which the government throws money automatically improves, but in the real world, there are oh-so-many examples of the best intentions of government spending going astray, and programs not improving despite increased spending.   It's very helpful to have a real world sense of these things ---- both GMAT CR and LSAT argument questions are consistent with the push & pull of real world forces.(A)is incorrect.(B) The cost of providing child-care services will increase.This is the direct result of the parallel logic.  Notice --- we don't know to whom the costs increase: will that increased cost be paid by the parents who want childcare, or by the government (i.e. by all taxpayers)?  We don't know, but this is irrelevant.  Regardless of who pays, the cost will be increased.(B)is a promising and plausible answer.(C) The government will use funding to foster advances in child care.Similar to(A).  Yes, the government is going to through money at the programs in the form of regulating it, but will these regulations produce radically improved programs?  Of course, that's the idealized hope, but there's no guarantee that this will be the outcome.(D)is incorrect.(D) If public criticism of policy is strongly voiced, the government is certain to respond.Very tricky.  This passage is very specifically about ""socially necessary services"".   The government funds a whole bunch of things that are not in the category of socially necessary services (the arts, environmental protection, diplomacy & foreign aid, etc. etc.)  Will the government respond to strong criticism about any of these?  We don't know.  It's well outside the scope of this argument.(D)is incorrect.(E) If child-care services are not regulated, the cost of providing child care will not increaseThis is the one about whichsmartmanavasked.  Technically, this answer choice is relying on a logical mistake known as the equivalence of a conditional statement and its inverse.   In formal language, the mistake isStarting with (if P, then Q), we conclude (if not P, then not Q).This is a logical fallacy.Consider these examples:Original:If I am in the SF Bay Area, then I am in California.TrueInverse:If I amnotin the SF Bay Area, then I amnotin California.False--- I could be in LA or San Diego or Tahoe or Yosemite or etc. California is a big state!Original:If a shape is a square, then it is a quadrilateral.TrueInverse:If a shape isnota square, then it isnota quadrilateral.False--- it could be a trapezoid, a slanted rhombus, an elongated rectangle, etc. etc.The argument makes the case thatIf government regulates, then costs increase.For the purposes of this question, we have to accept the prompt evidence as true.Essentially, answer choice(E)leaps from here to the inverse:If government does not regulate, then costs will not increase.If the government does not regular child care, that particular source of cost increase is eliminated, but that is certainly not a guarantee that nothing else at all will cause the price to increase.  There could be a labor dispute, lawsuits from parents, insurance increases, etc. etc. --- any one of a thousand other things that could cause the price of child care to increase.  We don't have a guarantee that the cost of child care will increase, but we certainly can't conclude definitively that the cost won't increase.  The truth is: if the government does not regular child care, we have absolutely no idea whether the cost of child care will increase or not.  We can draw no conclusion.   We have absolutely no grounds for concluding the inverse from the original conditional statement ---- this is a fundamental logical fallacy.(E)is incorrect.The only possible answer is(B).Does all of this make sense?Mike_________________Mike McGarryMagoosh Test PrepEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)Signature Read More Why is E not the answer , can someone explain ,In E it is mentioned that if no regulation happens then cost willnot increase , which can be inferred from the statement --->Government inevitably make the activity more expensive by regulating it ..... the government is certain to respond. how do u assume that government response can only be by regulation ??? crackHSWWhy is E not the answer , can someone explain ,In E it is mentioned that if no regulation happens then cost willnot increase , which can be inferred from the statement --->Government inevitably make the activity more expensive by regulating it ..... the government is certain to respond. how do u assume that government response can only be by regulation ???No assumption:Governments haveonlyone responseto public criticism of socially necessary services:regulationof the activity.

The correct answer choice is (B)This stimulus contains several statements that invite inferences. In the first sentence, we see that public criticism of a socially necessary service leads to government regulation. The third sentence just applies this to child care services: because child care services are a socially necessary service and are publicly criticized, they will be regulated.Answer Choices (A) is wrong because nothing in the stimulus addresses improving the quality of services. (A) assume that government intervention improves the quality. This may or may not be true.Answer Choice (B): This is the correct answer choice. The second sentence in the stimulus contains a broad statement: when an activity is regulated by the government, it becomes more expensive. We can apply this principle to what we learned from the third statement and determine that childcare services will become more expensive.Answer choice (C) is wrong because nothing in the stimulus addresses improving the quality of services. This answer choice assumes that government intervention improves the quality. This may or may not be true.Answer Choice (D), at first glance, seems like a good answer choice because it is consistent with the first sentence. However, the first sentence only talks about socially necessary services, not policy in general. (D), then, goes too far.Answer Choice (E) makes a logical error, a mistaken negation: we know that if child-care services are regulated, the cost will increase. But, we do not know anything if they are not regulated. Child care costs might increase anyway for some reason completely unrelated to regulation.

Does this necessarily mean that the quality of the child care programs will improve.  Perhaps in a magical fairyland, anything at which the government throws money automatically improves, but in the real world, there are oh-so-many examples of the best intentions of government spending going astray, and programs not improving despite increased spending.   It's very helpful to have a real world sense of these things ---- both GMAT CR and LSAT argument questions are consistent with the push & pull of real world forces.(A)is incorrect.(B) The cost of providing child-care services will increase.This is the direct result of the parallel logic.  Notice --- we don't know to whom the costs increase: will that increased cost be paid by the parents who want childcare, or by the government (i.e. by all taxpayers)?  We don't know, but this is irrelevant.  Regardless of who pays, the cost will be increased.(B)is a promising and plausible answer.(C) The government will use funding to foster advances in child care.Similar to(A).  Yes, the government is going to through money at the programs in the form of regulating it, but will these regulations produce radically improved programs?  Of course, that's the idealized hope, but there's no guarantee that this will be the outcome.(D)is incorrect.(D) If public criticism of policy is strongly voiced, the government is certain to respond.Very tricky.  This passage is very specifically about ""socially necessary services"".   The government funds a whole bunch of things that are not in the category of socially necessary services (the arts, environmental protection, diplomacy & foreign aid, etc. etc.)  Will the government respond to strong criticism about any of these?  We don't know.  It's well outside the scope of this argument.(D)is incorrect.(E) If child-care services are not regulated, the cost of providing child care will not increaseThis is the one about whichsmartmanavasked.

On the GMAT CR, absolutely not.   The GMAT is a magical world in which everything is perfectly logical, so a logical fallacy would carry no weight at all.  ON the GMAT CR, nothing good can come from a logical fallacy.That's on the GMAT.  In politics and in the business world, you will at times run into people, especially people in power, who simply want to believe whatever they believe, and if an argument for what they believe needs strengthening, a logical fallacy is just as good as anything else to support it.

Don't waste time and catch hold of that book immediately. There are specific rules you must follow to get to the answer.Rule 1: Always identify the conclusion and premises. If you are not able to do that, rephrase the sentences in your words in your thoughts to make a cause and effect statement. The effect is your conclusion and the causes are the premises.Rule 2: Strengthen, Weaken and Assumption questions more often than not impact the conclusion.Rule 3: Particularly you must inculcate the ability of identifying the wrong answer options and the tricks used for them. Option C is a classic Shell game answer and Option D is a classic out-of-scope answer option.If the conclusion, the first sentence of the given stimulus, claims that building better nests is the reason to successful breeding, to weaken it, all you have to do is look at the answer option that refutes it. How about improved fertility and vigor and not just better nests for successful breeding, is what that weakens the conclusion. Pretty straight forward, a weakening answer option attacks the conclusion that this is not all what it is, it could as well be something else. The answer should be B.The statement concludes that blackbirds benefit from their nesting experience, because they breed more successfully with each trial. However, if the capacity of blackbirds to lay viable eggs increases with age then it's not the experience that's affecting success of breeding. Instead it's an inherant biological factor that has nothing to do with experience. gurpreet07Learning how to build a nest plays an important part in the breeding success of birds.

In this context, it means ability - kind of like in a physiological context. In other words, (B) says that it is NOT the nesting experience that leads to more success in breeding but RATHER it is the adaptation of their bodies - every time they lay eggs, they get better!-Year 2 of breeding was more successful than Year 1; Year 3 was more successful than Year 2-This cannot be explained by size and strength-It must be explained by their nesting experienceI simply want to show why it is NOT the nesting experience that led to this.

Either way, I just want to show an alternative explanation as that is basically the best way to weaken this claim.(A) ""Other birds?"" Who cares?(B) Yea! If the ability to lay more viable eggs increases, then it is NOT the nesting experience but rather their physiology that explains the uptick in success: their eggs are more viable!(C) We basically already knew this: premise booster.(D) This actually strengthens by ruling out an alternative explanation. It says that strengthen and size don't matter! Thus, we couldn't just say, ""well during the 2nd and 3rd years the birds were stronger or bigger!"" to weaken this claim because (D) says, ""not so fast! Those things don't matter!"" Whenever we rule out an alternative explanation, we are strengthening the argument if just by a little.(E) ""All birds"" is too wide of a scope and we don't care about happens before they start to nest - we care about what happens after!

While some clearly means greater than 0.Still E is the best of the choices. Don't like that fact that LSAT makes some such lame jumps in logic, I thought only GMAT questions allow for loose logical reasoning.The statement ""most of X"" does not include ""all of X"" (otherwise one would say ""all of X"") at least in GMAT - the mathematical analogy that you are trying to draw here (most of something means greater than 50% of that thing, including 100% of that thing) may lead you to clicking on the wrong answer or at least spending a few seconds unnecessarily on the test day. It is beneficial to think that most of something is more than 50%, but less than 100%, because 100% of something would imply all of that thing. kpadmaThere is little point in looking to artists for insights into political issues.

Choice (C) is too extreme. Notice the absolute words “every” and “any.” Choice (D) is irrelevant. Finally, choice (E) is the measured response. If most artists are less insightful than other well-educated people, then we expect that some artists are as politically insightful as other well-educated people. Otherwise, the sentence would have read: all artists are less insightful than other well-educated people. Notice that choice (E) says very little and it misses the point of the passage. Nonetheless, it is best of the lot.The answer is (E)._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More C or Efor me, E would make sense:E) Some artists are no less politically insightful than some reasonably well-educated persons who are not artists.This sentence:Indeed, when taken as a whole, the statements made by artists, including those considered to be great, indicate that artistic talent and political insight arerarelyfound together. ->rarely means there is a realistic possibility. that means there ARE some artists no less ... I'm surprised LSAT questions have such flaws in their answers, especially those based on formal reasoning like this one. Not sure if the phrasing of the question - 'Which one of the followingcanbe inferred' makes it ok but basic set theory shows that Option E does not follow logically.Most can include 'all' too. While some clearly means greater than 0.Still E is the best of the choices. Don't like that fact that LSAT makes some such lame jumps in logic, I thought only GMAT questions allow for loose logical reasoning.

The stimulus says "" Most of them hold political views that are less insightful than those of any reasonably well-educated person who is not an artist""So, you are missing one point here.If I am saying MOST of them are less insightful, This would mean atleast 1 is there who is no less insightful.Say I have total 100 artists. I am saying 99 are less insightful (Take this as MOST are), it means atleast 1 is there who is no less or more insightful.

So, I approached this as more of an assumption question; I was on the lookout for a necessary assumption as I went to the answers.The conclusion is found in the first sentence, while the remainder of the argument is structured to support this first sentence. Notice how qualified the author's statements are and, in particular, I think the key words to pay attention to are ""little point"" in the conclusion. The words ""rarely found together"" are very important from the final sentence, which acts as a premise in the argument.The assumption that jumped out at me almost immediately was that the author must think that there is still ""some"" point to look to artists for political insights, or else he/she would have said ""there's no point"" in the conclusion (instead of saying that there's ""little point""). Furthermore, the author would have used the word ""never"" instead of ""rarely"" in the final sentence, which is a premise of course. But why is this the case, you might ask? The reason for this must be that, as (E) points out, there must some artists that are just as politically insightful as the other group; if there weren't, the argument would fall apart instantaneously!So, if one approached this question like I did, answers (A), (B), and (D) could be seen to be hopeless from the get-go.Answer (C) is wrong because it weakens the argument directly and before you even negate it. If this answer were true, then why would there be ""little point"" or why would they ""rarely"" be found together?So, to summarize, (C) is wrong because it weakens before it is negated and tends to strengthen the argument after it is negated. Answer choice (E) does the exact opposite and is thus the correct answer. Hinightblade354Need your help.Why is D not correct?Quote:(D) Politicians rarely have any artistic talent.My reasoning was this is given in the passage - ""...indicate that artistic talent and political insight are rarely found together.""Can we not make the assumption that Politicians have political insight? AnirudhaSHinightblade354Need your help.Why is D not correct?Quote:(D) Politicians rarely have any artistic talent.My reasoning was this is given in the passage - ""...indicate that artistic talent and political insight are rarely found together.""Can we not make the assumption that Politicians have political insight?The reason (D) is wrong is because we have no information about politicians. We are only told information about artists (remember, the premise is derived strictly from the viewpoint of the data, which is from the artistic group), and we can NEVER assume anything that is not stated unless it is an assumption question. But to add on a little more, who is to say politicians have political insight? Have you seen the US recently? You'd have to assume that politicians have political insight, but even then this is a stretch to make the argument work for the answer choice._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

Recall: To weaken an argument, we typically must attack a premise—either expressed or suppressed—of the argument. Now the underlying premise of any controlled experiment is that there are no outside variables affecting its outcome. Two variables that come immediately to mind are 1) there may be another source for the helium-4, and 2) helium-4 may be naturally occurring in air. Now if the amount of helium-4 in the air after the experiment is the same as before the experiment, then clearly the researchers’ claim would be spurious.Hence the answer is (C)._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More BunuelNuclear fusion is a process whereby the nuclei of atoms are joined, or “fused,” and in which energy is released.

Conclusion- Fusion was achieved since a measurable amount of He-4 was found in the air of the chamber.Type- WeakenPre thinking-I need to prove that fusion was not achieved. That's all i can thought at first glance.A) Helium-4 was not the only gas found in the experiment chamber.- Let X be the other gas which is present in the chamber. I still don't know whether fusion was achieved.(B) When fusion is achieved, it normally produces several by-products, including tritium and gamma rays.- The premise never says that He-4 was the only gas found in the chamber. There might be other rays or gases produced. I need to weaken the conclusion by pointing out the ""measurable amount of Helium-4 gas found in the chamber"". This option does not add any value to my conclusion.(C) The amount of helium-4 found in the chamber’s air did not exceed the amount of helium-4 that is found in ordinary air.- By this fact, i can say the amount of He-4 found in the chamber= amount of He-4 found in the ordinary air. If so, how can i say if fusion has really happened in the chamber? This weakens my conclusion.(D) Helium-4 gas rapidly breaks down, forming ordinary helium gas after a few hours.- May be but time and temperature can no where impact this argument.(E) Nuclear fusion reactions are characterized by the release of large amounts of heat.- As i said in B, it was never mentioned that He-4 was the only by-product found in the chamber. There might be heat produced during the process. Nuclear fusion is a process whereby the nuclei of atoms are joined, or “fused,” and in which energy is released. One of the by-products of fusion is helium-4 gas. A recent fusion experiment was conducted using “heavy” water contained in a sealed flask. The flask was, in turn, contained in an air-filled chamber designed to eliminate extraneous vibration. After the experiment, a measurable amount of helium-4 gas was found in the air of the chamber. The experimenters cited this evidence in support of their conclusion that fusion had been achieved.Which one of the following, if true, would cast doubt on the experimenters’ conclusion?(A) Helium-4 was not the only gas found in the experiment chamber. - WRONG. Like B and E only.(B) When fusion is achieved, it normally produces several by-products, including tritium and gamma rays. - WRONG. Not affecting the conclusion in any way.(C) The amount of helium-4 found in the chamber’s air did not exceed the amount of helium-4 that is found in ordinary air. - CORRECT. If not then it helps the conclusion otherwise breaks it as in the amount is normal.(D) Helium-4 gas rapidly breaks down, forming ordinary helium gas after a few hours. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(E) Nuclear fusion reactions are characterized by the release of large amounts of heat. - WRONG. Nothing about heat is conclusive enough to support the conclusion of the passage.Answer C._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Could someone please explain B? The math is not mathing for me We're told that nondairy products have 2g of fat, and that this is 7 times the saturated fat of milk. So milk has about 2/7 g of saturated fat. However, milk has 2 mg of cholesterol, while the nondairy products have none. So here's what we have:Nondairy: 2g sat fat, 0 mg cholesterolMilk: ~.29 g sat fat, 2 mg cholesterolWe're also told that we treat 1g of sat fat like 25 mg of cholesterol. Since nondairy has over 1g more sat fat than milk has, it's as if it has more than 25 mg more cholesterol than coffee, so we'd expect it to have a stronger effect on blood cholesterol. If you want to geek out on the math (try not to during a timed problem), here it is:Difference in sat fat = 2 - 0.29 = 1.71 g. Cholesterol equivalent = 1.71(25 mg) =42.75 mg. So according to this formula, it's as if nondairy has ~43 mg cholesterol, vs. just 2 for milk.

"The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases.(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skier increased between 1950 and 1980.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury.(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline.(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.ShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","Takdirwhy the answer is E?You can look at the argument in math terms.1950: 9 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --> Off slopes injuries are 10% of injuries. So, 9 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 90% of injuries.Total injuries per 1000 1950: 9 on slopes +  1 off slopes = 10 total1980: 3 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --> Off slopes injuries are 25% of injuries. So, 3 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 75% of injuries.Total injures per 1000 1980: 3 on slopes + 1 off slopes = 4 totalNow let's look at the answer choices.(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on theslopes decreases, the number of injuries thatoccur on the premises of ski resorts increases.No. The off slope number per 1000 did not change.(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skierincreased between 1950 and 1980.There is no reason to believe this, especially as off slope injuries did not increase.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindingsaffects the incidence of each type ofski-related injury.Actually, off slope injuries did not change even after the introduction of the ski boots and bindings.(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindingscontinues to advance, the incidence ofski-related injuries will continue to decline.This seems likely, but the prompt does not actually indicate that this is the case. The prompt discusses what happened in the past without saying much that indicates what would happen in the future should the technology continue to advance.(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of skiresorts made up a smaller percentage ofski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.This  is true.

We’re told that, from 1950 to 1980, the percentage of all ski-related injuries at ski resorts that did not occur on the slopes increased from 10% to 25%. That must mean that the percentage of ski-related injuries at ski resorts that did occur on the slopes must have decreased over that same period. Think about it this way: there are only two possible alternatives for a ski related injury: either it occurs on the slopes or it does not occur on the slopes. So if the share of ski-related injuries represented by one type of injury goes up, the share represented by the other type MUST go down. That’s choice (E).(A) We have no information about the number of the different types of ski-related injuries occurring, only about the percentage of total injuries represented by the two different types of injuries. Since we don’t know how or whether the total number of injuries changed, we can’t infer (A).(B) We can infer nothing about the amount of alcohol consumed. It’s true that increased alcohol consumption causes an increase in injuries off the slopes, but we don’t know that those injuries have increased numerically, nor do we know that alcohol consumption is the only thing that could bring about an increase.(C) Although the stimulus says improved ski boots and bindings have decreased the incidence of injuries on the slopes, it never implies that they have any effect on off-slopeinjuries.(D) is unwarranted for two reasons: first, the fact that better boots and bindings have reduced the incidence of on-slope injuries in the past is no guarantee that they will do so in the future and, second, (D) speaks of “ski-related injuries” in general, and we have no reason to believe that boots and bindings have any effect on the incidence of off-slope injuries. (A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases. -Relation between ski injuries on slopes and premises of ski resorts is not mentioned in the argument - Incorrect(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skier increased between 1950 and 1980. -Cannot be inferred from the passage - Incorrect(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury. -Out of scope - Incorrect(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline. -Cannot be inferred with the information given in the passage - Incorrect(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950. -The injuries on the slopes has decreased from the year 1950 to 1980. That would automatically decrease the percentage share of injuries on slopes over the total number of injuries - Correct I used some Mathematics to tackle this question...1.) 9 Injuries on the slopes in 1950, 10% of all injuries were not on the slopes. So we can say that 1 injury occurred in the premises of the ski resort.1/10- 10% of all Injuries are on the premises.2.) 3 Injuries on the slopes in 1980, 25% of all injuries were not on the slopes. So we can say that 1 injury occurred in the premises of the ski resort.1/4- 25% of all Injuries are on the premises.(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases.----Incorrect, as you can see above that number of ski injuries decreases from 9 to 3 but then number of injuries that occur on the premises stay the same.(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skier increased between 1950 and 1980.---Out of scope. No information regarding alcohol consumption(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury.----Each type is taking it too far isn't it??? The technology must have affected some of the injuries but definitely not all...(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline.----This is a future event. What if there cannot be any more decline in the injuries no matter what you do with ski boots and bindings...(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.---CORRECT, as you can see in the analysis above, Injuries that occurred on the slopes in 1980-3/4=75% whereas in 1950- 9/10-90%. Absolutely TRUE. B. We're not told that the amount of alco comsumedper skierhas been increased. So it could have been remained the same.C. Tricky one, however it coversall typesof ski-related injuries and since we are told that off-slope injuries are classified as ski-related injuries as well that statement cannot be inferred from the argument as long as despite the fact the ski&bindings technology advances we see that it doesn't affect positively off-slope injuries. LegendaddyThe advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases, the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases.(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skier increased between 1950 and 1980.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence of each type of ski-related injury.(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries will continue to decline.(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.Source: LSATA) Is not inferrable. A decrease in the % of slope injuries will necessarily lead to an increase of % non-slope injuries in terms of the % of all ski injuries. So we do not have to have more injuries on the non-slope side. It could stay the same or even drop, just not by as much as the slope side.B) Could be true, not necessarily true. This can be thought of as reversed logic. We know that alcohol could lead to the increase. And we do have an increase. Does not mean alcohol was the cause.C) Each type of ski injury? We know it is affecting ski injuries, but not every type.D) Temporal flaw. We cannot infer anything about the future.E) Wins by default. However, it can still be proved.We know that the % of slope injuries in 1950 was 90% while in 1980 it was 75%. Saw the question rated as ""hard""-LSAT question, was anxious to press the E) button for a whole lot of time but it turns out to be that straight forward - I am so prone to looking for traps that I went through the numbers 10 times - lolgood one!_________________Let's get someSignature Read More Took me way too long...The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the slopes decreases,the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resorts increases. XNo...this is taking things way too far.(B) Theamount of alcoholconsumed per skier increased between 1950 and 1980. XYes the incidence of ski-related injuries goes up as the amount of alcohol consumed per skier increases, but this is not the same as saying the amount of alcohol consumed per skier did in fact increase ...it may have, it may have not.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings affects the incidence ofeach type of ski-related injury. XThere's not enough info. to infer this.(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings continues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injurieswill continue to decline.Past is not indicative of the future. This choice also fails to take into account other reasons for injuries (e.g. horseplay)(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.CORRECTInjuries that occurred on the resort increased from 10-25% ...so such injuries take a bigger chunk out of the pie...as a result the percentage of injuries that occurred because of the slope decreased (stated in the passage). I narrowed it down to B & E, and had a problem eliminating B. So, just delineating how I went about it.Let's look at option B.Mathematically:In 1950:Number of Skiers = 1000Number of on-slope injuries = 9 (given 9 injuries per 1000 skiers)Number of non-slope injuries = 1 (because non-slope injuries were 10% of all injuries. So, 90% of all injuries = 9)Let's say consuming >= 100 mL alcohol makes one prone to non-slope injuries.So, alcohol consumption rate = 1*100mL/1000 skiersIn 1980:Number of Skiers = 1000Number of on-slope injuries = 3Number of non-slope injuries = 1 (because non-slope = 25% of all injuries.)So, alcohol consumption rate = 1*100mL/1000So, it is possible that the alcohol consumption rate didn't increase at all.Also, we can argue that since the number of non-slope injuries in 1980 < in 1950, the alcohol consumed in 1980 < alcohol consumed in 1950. So, the rate in 1980 can at best be equal to the rate in 1950.Option E is justified.In 1950:Contribution of non-slope injuries = 10%Therefore, Contribution of slope-injuries = 90%In 1980:Contribution of non-slope injuries = 25%Therefore, Contribution of slope-injuries = 75%Comparing [Percentage of on-slope injuries] in 1950 to [Percentage of on-slope injuries] in 1980 = 90% vs 75%. E is correct. MartyTargetTestPrepTakdirwhy the answer is E?You can look at the argument in math terms.1950: 9 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --> Off slopes injuries are 10% of injuries. So, 9 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 90% of injuries.Total injuries per 1000 1950: 9 on slopes +  1 off slopes = 10 total1980: 3 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --> Off slopes injuries are 25% of injuries. So, 3 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 75% of injuries.Total injures per 1000 1980: 3 on slopes + 1 off slopes = 4 totalNow let's look at the answer choices.(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on theslopes decreases, the number of injuries thatoccur on the premises of ski resorts increases.No. The off slope number per 1000 did not change.(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skierincreased between 1950 and 1980.There is no reason to believe this, especially as off slope injuries did not increase.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindingsaffects the incidence of each type ofski-related injury.Actually, off slope injuries did not change even after the introduction of the ski boots and bindings.(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindingscontinues to advance, the incidence ofski-related injuries will continue to decline.This seems likely, but the prompt does not actually indicate that this is the case. The prompt discusses what happened in the past without saying much that indicates what would happen in the future should the technology continue to advance.(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of skiresorts made up a smaller percentage ofski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.This  is true. In 1950, on slopes injuries constituted 90% of injuries. In 1980, on slopes injuries constituted 75% of injuries.The correct answer is E.Hello Marty,The question stem""from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980.""doesn't explicitly mention that 3 were injured out of 1000 skiers in 1980. What if the number of skiers also declined, leading to fewer injuries in 1980? That's why I crossed E and chose B. The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A)Asthe number of ski injuries that occur on the slopesdecreases,the number of injuries that occur on the premises of ski resortsincreases. - WRONG. It suggests that there's some correlation between the two types of injuries but it is not inferable from the passage. In that percentage terms are used wherein here it is numbers.(B) Theamount of alcohol consumed per skier increasedbetween 1950 and 1980. - WRONG. Not at all inferable as alcohol amount was per skier but this option says in terms of total amount which is not inferable.(C) The technology of ski boots and bindingsaffectsthe incidence of each type of ski-related injury. - WRONG. Seems to suggest that technology directly impacts but it's not.(D)Ifthe technology of ski boots and bindingscontinues to advance, the incidence of ski-related injuries willcontinue to decline. - WRONG. Just like A this tries to correlate but this is not necessarily true.(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski resorts made up a smaller percentage of ski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950. - CORRECT. If not than our conclusion seems to falter. Thus, this is inferable infact it is an assumption type inferance that has to be true.Answer E._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Why? Because they satisfy all our government tests (tough tests!) and with foreign-made parts you can't tell if they're good or cheapos that will break.There's a few gaps in this argument. For one, perhaps I'm convinced we should buy domestic parts that pass these tests, but why Clark? Why not Clark's domestic competitor that passes all the tests AND offers discounts?Furthermore, how good are these tests? Sure they're the toughest, but are they tough enough? Could you pass these tests and still be a cheap, liable-to-break car part?(D) ""deals"" with this second issue - it assures us that the parts that pass are not as bad as the cheapo foreign ones. If you negate (D), it destroys the argument.(A) is out of scope - we're not interested in whether we can get them but if we should.(B) is too extreme and is out of scope. We don't need to assume that the foreign parts don't work for domestic cars. We already know those foreign parts are problematic. Also, this argument has never been restricted to parts for domestic cars. Out of scope.(C) is too extreme. The argument's premise allows for some foreign parts to be high-quality. The issue is that you can't tell if a foreign part is good or not.(E) is tempting, but we're not interested in any part made in this country; we're concerned with Clark parts!

The advertisement tries to convince us to buy Clark parts and cites the fact that Clark parts, unlike foreign-made parts, have passed government tests. So Clark parts are subject to government tests, whereas foreign-made parts are not. So what? We still don’t know how tough those tests are. If parts that pass those tests are just as flimsy as cheap foreign parts (the denial of (D)), then Clark parts don’t look so hot after all.(A) is irrelevant. The issue is the quality of Clark parts, not their availability.(B) and (C) may strengthen the argument if true, but are not necessary for the argument to stand. Even if some foreign-made parts were suitable for cars in the country (the denial of (B)), or if some foreign-made parts did measure up to our standards (the denial of (C)), Clark parts might still be the smart choice, and so neither (B) nor (C) is the necessary assumption on which the argument depends.(E) guarantees that all parts made for cars manufactured in our country (including Clark parts) are not poorly constructed. If some of those parts were poorly constructed (the denial of answer choice (E)), then Clark still might be tops, since their parts need not be the flimsy ones.• Some assumptions may jump right out at you—if not, the Denial Test/Negation Test provides another way of testing the choices. In this question, it may be hard to see why answer choice (D) is necessary until you think of what would happen if it were false. Or, it may be hard to see why (B), (C), and (E) are wrong until you deny them and see that the argument could still be valid. s4ur4bhI think D.Whats OA?Why D?1. Because I can eliminate A,B and E.2.

It can happen that more babies are born in good locality and as a result the infant mortality in US is steadily declining.GMATNinjakarishmaThe passage points out that the ""overall"" rate of infant mortality has been declining in the United States. But then, it tells us this doesn't necessarily mean that babies are now, ""on average,"" healthier at birth. The right answer should support this statement.Let's now consider (A):Quote:Which one of the following reasons, if true, most strongly supports the claim made above about the implications of the decline?(A) The figure for infant mortality is compiled as an overall rate and thus masks deficiencies in particular localities.How does (A) impact the statement in the passage? Well, the passage already tells us that the infant mortality rate in the U.S. is an ""overall"" rate, and that certain areas have high infant mortality (i.e. higher than many developing countries). So (A) doesn't really add anything new.From another angle -- it's true, as the passage says, that some localities in the U.S. have higher rates of infant mortality than many developing countries. So it's possible that babies inthose specific localitiesare not healthier than babies were in the past. But we also know that despite that, the ""overall"" rate of infant mortality is declining. So the fact thatsome localitieshave deficiencies still wouldn't explain why babies ""on average"" in the U.S. are no more healthy, despite the ""overall"" declining infant mortality rate.For both those reason, (A) is incorrect.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More The passage conclusion comparesthe average health status of babies at PRESENTwiththe average health status of babies in PAST.Although the overall infant mortality rate has declined.

So next statement should describe THE KEY. which is ""independent of outside imposition"".(E) the more independent a school is, the more educational progress it will makeis wrong, because premises state that:cultures advance only when independence replaces dependence. There isno comparative degree into it.culture will progress only when there is no INDEPENDENCE. The key to complete the passage question is to identify the general flow. Here, the keyword ""therefore"" indicates, we are looking for a standard conclusion. E is more standard than any other given option. For individual schools, an analogy by comparing with cultures is drawn to support that they'll make progress if they function independently - that's about it, PERIOD!!!! Also, conclusions are preferred to keep in a smooth mode, rather than a strong verbiage such as ""must"". Hi,the correct answer is most definitely choice A.Here, the task is to ascertain the conclusion: to judge what conclusion the passage is intended to support.Because the evidence of the passage traffics in ""only""(s), the passage is intended to support the extreme conclusion that independence is a ""must"".Thus, choice A is the only choice that correctly completes the passage. Torn between A and E but going with A here i.e Individual schools must be independent of outside imposition broallAnthropologists assert that cultures advance only when independence replaces dependence—that is, only when imposition by outsiders is replaced by initiative from within.

The idea of a comparative spectrum of independence is out of scope.Some schools require more independence not depending on the initiatives they got, but depending on how much outsider imposition there is.(C): School system officials would be considered an outsider, so this can be eliminated.(D): Argument said that outsiders can still provide valuable advice. So it's not that outsiders must be prevented from all help. Further, the necessary condition as stated in the first sentence is about replacing outside imposition with insider initiatives(E): The first statement seemed pretty absolute. Culture can advance ONLY when outside imposition replaced with insider initiatives. So a school could become a little more independent, but not replace all of the outsider imposition, and it would still not make any progress Hi Experts kindly explain option C and A. I marked C but it seems to be wrong. prerakgoel07Hi Experts kindly explain option C and A. I marked C but it seems to be wrong.The key here is that ""imposition by outsiders"" must be replaced by ""initiative from within"".Quote:(C) school system officials must tailor their initiatives for change to each individual school in the systemWe have a system of schools, and some officials in charge of that system of schools. This does not refer to officialswithineach of the individual schools. Instead, it refers to officials in charge of several individual schools (all of the schools within that school system).So the initiatives come from outsiders (the school system officials) rather than insiders (leaders within each individual school). (C) must be eliminated.Quote:(A) individual schools must be independent of outside imposition""Cultures (or schools) advance only when independence replaces dependence."" Therefore, in order to have education progress, the schools have to be independent. In other words, initiatives should come from leaders within each individual school rather than from outsiders (for example, school system officials who oversee several different schools).I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Correct option-AOption E seems wrong because the main jist of the question stem lies in the line below""the natives of a culture are the only ones who can move that culture forward"". and natives will take""initiatives from within"".Initiatives from within moves the culture forward.Option E does not cover this idea. tenaman10Anthropologists assert that cultures advance only when independence replaces dependence—that is, only when imposition by outsiders is replaced by initiative from within.

The argument states that a rule can be changed only if two criteria are meet: First, 10 percent of the tenants must sign a petition to change the rule. Second, an election must be held in which a majority of the tenants vote in favor of changing the rule. The argument states that the rule was not changed and then concludes that the proposal to change the rule must have been voted down.

We need to defend that condition in order for the conclusion to be drawn properly.The argument depends on which one of the following assumptions?Quote:(A) The pet lovers succeeded in obtaining the signatures of 10 percent of the tenants on their petition.This protects the condition.

(B) is outQuote:(C) Ninety percent of the tenants are against changing the rule forbidding pets.This may be true, but does it have to be true? No, 80%, 70%, 60%, or greater than 50% will successfully dismiss the changing request. Also, this does not close the GAP whether the the signatures of 10% of the tenants have been obtained. (C) is outQuote:(D) The support of 10 percent of the tenants for a rule change ensures that the rule change will be adopted.This is again does not say anything about whether the signatures have been obtained.

There are multiples ways to undermine an argument among which we can mention *unrepresentative sample or any errors that may appear in data which support the conclusion *.Premise : investigators went into the street and found twenty volunteers born under the sign of Gemini who were willing to be interviewed on the program and to take a personality test.Premise : The test confirmed the investigators' personal impressions that each of the volunteers was more sociable and extroverted than people are on averageThe conclusion is : one's astrological birth sign influence one's personality. The preceding words clearly show that all that was mentioned in the text is mentioned to claim the final sentence of the stimulus which is therefore the conclusion.Answer A: one may think that if it’s not investigators who administered the test the data are flawed but thinking that way would be helping the argument which clearly did not state that. No information related to the ability of those who conducted the experiment is provided so we cannot conclude anything about the quality of data. So it neither undermines nor helps the argument. Out!Answer B : actually this one strengthens the argument. Let’s say this another way: Gemini people are more sociable than any other astronomical signs. We can conclude that the astronomical sign plays one role in some sort on the behavior of people. Ouch! Out!Answer C : This one is irrelevant because the point of the argument is not the impression investigators have on people but the relation between astrological signs of people and their behavior. Ouch! Out!Answer D : Still irrelevant friendo. Why? Because the argument talks about the relationship between people behavior and their astronomical signs and not between astrological signs and the proportions in the population.Answer E: If you made till here you are goat because you are right. This answer simply states that the sample is biased in some sort or unrepresentative of the population. Among Gemini only those who are extroverted and sociable participate. There may be some others Gemini who are not sociable and extroverted  but we may never know because they do not participate to the experiment.Mr nobodyPosted from my mobile device",https://gmatclub.com/forum/for-a-television-program-about-astrology-201076.html

You indeed cleared my doubt. After reading your falsification question, I could immediately point B as an answer. I think, I went wrong at the falsification question step. I need to take more care on that aspect..[/quote]Your falsification questions were right to the point , but they were not detailed enough...Also you stopped after falsification condition and directly jumped to thought process in which you did not consider the GIVEN ( author's REASONING) and tried to come up with your own REASONING... Try to make a falsification condition as DETAILED as possible...For eg : this year disease X has downsized the amount of meat available from chicken as disease X affects chicken. Therefore this year the meat available from chicken will be less in amount than last year.If we don't consider detailsProbable falsification condition: what if other meat from cows or sheep increases??Here you'll be considering the total amount of meat available.but the conclusion is only about meat available from CHICKEN and not total.Detailed falsification condition:What if somehow we can increase the amount of avaible chicken for meat?? What if we eradicate disease ?Here you'll only be concerned with meat from chicken.Note: this is just an example. I in no way imply that you would come up with the former falsification condition. I chose E as my answer. Please correct my understanding.I chose E because for these reasons:The school kids in Europe participate in calisthenics program and hence the reason why they are physical fit. The last statement states that North American kids can be fit only if they participate in such programs.So, I felt the assumption should be - If North America implements a similar program, to achieve the similar goal of making kids physically fit , we need to consider how the effectively the program will be run in North America.So, we are assuming that these programs would be executed effectively. In Europe, schoolchildren devote time during each school day to calisthenics. North American schools rarely offer a daily calisthenics program. Tests prove that North American children are weaker, slower, and shorter-winded than European children. We must conclude that North American children can be made physically fit only if they participate in school calisthenics on a daily basis.Which of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?(A) Physical fitness is a compelling national priority worthy of taxpayer resources.  --Irrelevant(B) School calisthenics programs are an indispensable factor in European student fitness.  --Best among the lot.(C) All children can be made equally physically fit.  --""Equally"" makes the statement too hypothetical to believe. Can't serve as a proper assumption.(D) European schoolchildren enjoy physical activities more than do American children.  --Irrelevant(E) American physical education teachers are capable of designing a successful calisthenics program.  --We can't say this from the information given. It just says that North American schools rarely conduct calisthenics programs but that doesn't mean the teachers there are unsuccessful LeonaannI chose E as my answer. Please correct my understanding.I chose E because for these reasons:The school kids in Europe participate in calisthenics program and hence the reason why they are physical fit. The last statement states that North American kids can be fit only if they participate in such programs.So, I felt the assumption should be - If North America implements a similar program, to achieve the similar goal of making kids physically fit , we need to consider how the effectively the program will be run in North America.So, we are assuming that these programs would be executed effectively.Really good question.  I've always loved this problem for showcasing the critical importance of knowing *exactly* what the conclusion is saying.  Here that ""only"" looms super large: the conclusion is not saying that North America should implement this program...it's saying that the only way to make N.A. children physically fit (whether or not anyone chooses to take this recommendation) is via a daily school calisthenics program.  That's the only chance they have - not through recreational soccer leagues or healthy lunch initiatives or a 1000% percent tax on pizza and candy bars.  This specific conclusion isn't saying we should make these kids fit...it's saying that *if* we want to, the ONLY way to do it is through this particular program.This makes a couple things wrong with E:1) Note that E is overly specific with who is capable of designing the program.  Do we need it to be designed specifically by American physical education teachers?  Why couldn't it be the teachers from London or Zurich who designed the Euro programs?  Or scientists from Johns Hopkins?2) It misses the point of the conclusion ever so slightly.  If we had a conclusion that ""the only way for humankind to survive global warming is to move to or colonize another planet"" that conclusion can exist even if there's no known way to colonize another planet.  The conclusion isn't saying that this plan will work...just that the others cannot work, so if there's a way to get it done it has to be done via this method (whether this method is possible or not).In a larger context here, the huge lesson is to make sure you pay attention to specific language within the conclusion.  The word ""only"" here does a ton of work to limit the conclusion to a really narrow meaning: daily school calisthenics are the ONLY hope for student fitness in North America. VeritasPrepBrian-It was between B and C for me and i chose CI thought C had to be the assumption because for the argument becauseIf there are kids that cannot be equally fit to the rest of the class --  introducing calisthenics in that case in North America would be pointless (Even if Europeans did it) for these kidsthus i thought -- C has to be true for ALL kids to be equally fitIf even one child cannot be fit -- introducing calisthenics for this child was pointlessPlease let me know your thoughts Really good question! Let me actually break down two important words in (C):1) Equally.  This is the one I've always used to eliminate this one.  Do we really need them to be EQUALLY physically fit?  If some kids are ready to compete for Mr. Olympia or the Olympic heptathlon and others are merely average-level club soccer players, we still have fit children.  ""Equally"" is unnecessary...and actually kind of crazy if you think about it. That's a much taller task than just making people 'fit' - there's a bell curve for basically every measurement in the world (height, IQ, blood pressure, salary, whatever) so why would we need this *one* metric to be the one that can be perfectly uniform?2) All. We don't need all children to become physically fit at all - we only care about North American children (for the purposes of this conclusion).  So if a handful of kids in Russia or New Zealand simply can't become physically fit, that doesn't ruin the conclusion at all.  The conclusion is perfectly fine with certain children not becoming fit...it only cares about a subset, so ""not all children can become physically fit"" doesn't wreck the conclusion.Ohhhhh and actually that leads me to another big point for you about negation.  When you negate an assumption you take the ""logical opposite"" of that conclusion, not the polar opposite.  And the reason for that is we're really just testing ""do we need this conclusion or not?"" so the purpose of negation is to just remove that conclusion and say it's not true.The logical opposite of ""all children can be made physically fit"" is ""NOT all children can be made physically fit"" - it's not ""no children can..."" or ""all children cannot.""  We're trying to basically consider ""no that's not true"" to see if we need the assumption, and that's why the LOGICAL OPPOSITE is so important there.Basically that technique - if you see a choice start with some/all/none, take the logical opposite of that.  If it doesn't, then negate the verb in the main clause of the sentence. In Europe, schoolchildren devote time during each school day to calisthenics. North American schools rarely offer a daily calisthenics program. Tests prove that North American children are weaker, slower, and shorter-winded than European children. We must conclude that North American children can be made physically fit only if they participate in school calisthenics on a daily basis.Which of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?Argument:Tests prove that North American Children are weaker , slower, and shorter-winded than European Children.(A) Physical fitness is a compelling national priority worthy of taxpayer resources.We are not talking about tax payers money here. It is out of context. Also the word "" Compelling "" is an extreme word which should be avoided.(B) School calisthenics programs are an indispensable factor in European student fitness.The argument states, that North American Children are weaker and etc than European children + Assumption states, Calisthenics programs are an important factor in European Children fitness = Conclusion: North American children can only be made fit if they have calisthenics programs.(C) All children can be made equally physically fit.If all children can be made equally physically fit, then why are North American children not fit.(D) European schoolchildren enjoy physical activities more than do American children.European school children like physical activities or not is a separate question all together. The schools forcibly implements these classes, so that they remain fit whether they like it or not. North American schools do not have any such provision. If all the decisions are left to students, they might not want anything that is why schools or other authorities play important roles in developing the personality of a child. And it is written in the conclusion also, that they will only become fitter if they participate in the school calisthenics on a daily basis, whether they like it or not.(E) American physical education teachers are capable of designing a successful calisthenics program.Neither in argument nor in conclusion have they mentioned about teachers capability of designing a program. They are talking about school implementing a specific program for it's students.Hope it helps! VeritasPrepBrian- I tried re-doing this and i selected E unfortunately.I immediately eliminated B because I thought to myself-- why does it matter for American kids ifEuropean kids consider School calisthenics programs are an indispensable factor in European student fitness.It seems like a totally different group of individuals.How would you suggest I get think about this problem In Europe, schoolchildren devote time during each school day to calisthenics. North American schools rarely offer a daily calisthenics program. Tests prove that North American children are weaker, slower, and shorter-winded than European children. We must conclude that North American children can be made physically fit only if they participate in school calisthenics on a daily basis.Which of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?(A) Physical fitness is a compellingnational priorityworthy of taxpayer resources. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(B) School calisthenics programs are an indispensable factor in European student fitness. - CORRECT. Not a true assumption as one might think of but relatively better than other choices. It does require another level of assumption.(C)Allchildren can be madeequally physically fit. - WRONG. Two extremes - 'all' and 'equally' and both are not required.(D) European schoolchildrenenjoyphysical activities more than do American children. - WRONG. Irrelevant.(E) American physical education teachers are capable of designing a successful calisthenics program. - WRONG. There's no mention of PE Teachers, so it doesn't matter.Answer B._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hi Experts,I'm not able to understand how Option B is correct.

As per the 1st line of the passage ""In Europe, schoolchildren devote time during each school day to calisthenics."" Isn't option B restatement of this part of the passage.(B) says something different from what the passage says.The passage says the following:In Europe, schoolchildren devote time during each school day to calisthenics.OK, so all the passage says is that European children do calisthenics.Here's (B):(B) School calisthenics programs are an indispensable factor in European student fitness.(B) adds the information that calisthenics programs are ""indispensable."" In other words, (B) states the assumption that, to be fit, European children NEED calisthenics. This assumption is necessary for the argument to work. After all, the argument is that North American children can be made physically fit ONLY IF they participate in school calisthenics on a daily basis. To arrive at that conclusion the author must assume that calisthenics are NECESSARY. After all, if they are not necessary, then North American children may be able to become fit in another way.Quote:I ended up selecting Option E as if we negate it we get  ""American physical education teachers are NOT capable of designing a successful calisthenics program"" Thus even if American children participate in calisthenics on  a daily basis, they wont be physically fit .Notice that the conclusion is not that North American children will become fit. It's just that they NEED calisthenics to become fit. So, we don't need to assume that a program they use will be successful._________________Marty Murray | Chief Curriculum and Content ArchitectBiggest Sale of the Year | Get 25% Off All TTP GMAT Plans | Apply Code:BLACKFRIDAY25Perfect 5-Star Rating on GMAT Club5-Day Full Access Trial For FREESee why Target Test Prep is the top rated GMAT course on GMAT Club.Read Our ReviewsSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Similarly this option states that whatever is false cannot be used to prove anything. This matches the argument word by word(B) The whole truth cannot be known. -Irrelevant.

Therefore, it can never be used to prove something. The assumption needed to connect these two sentences is that if something cannot express the whole truth then it cannot prove anything. The answer, therefore, is (A).The other choices are easily ruled out. As to (B), the argument does not state that the whole truth cannot be known, merely that it cannot be knownthrougha photograph. Choice (C) is similarly flawed. The argument does not state that a photograph cannot express the truth inanysense, merely that it cannot express thewholetruth. (Again, beware of absolute statements.) Choice (D) is a reasonable assumption to make, but it is not relevant to the argument. Finally, choice (E) contradicts the argument._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More I selected the answer as C which appears to be wrong.

Unexpectedly, it has since been found that a large number of childrenwho are riding in safety seatscontinue to receive serious injuries that safety seats were specifically designed to avoid, and in the prevention of which they in fact have proven to be effective.Conclusion : Since safety seats have been designed to save children from injury, it must save children from serious injury. There must be something wrong, it might be possible that parents are not using it properly or not using it at all. But the questions stem says that a large number of children who are riding in safety seats continue to receive serious injuries which means, the safety seats are being used but not used in a proper manner as per the guidelines.(A) Many parents are defying the law by not using safety seats for their children.The question stem says that children are getting injured in safety seats. So, safety seats are used.(B) Children are more likely to make automobile trips now than they were before the introduction of the safety seat.Even if children are more likely to make automobile trips, the injuries should not increase due to use of safety seat.(C) The high cost of child safety seats has caused many parents to delay purchasing them.The question stem says that children are getting injured in safety seats. So, safety seats are used. Same as A.(D) The car safety seat was not designed to prevent all types of injuries, so it is not surprising that some injuries are sustained.Even if the seats are not designed to prevent all types of injuries, the no. of injuries should actually decrease..(E) The protection afforded by child safety seats depends on their being used properly, which many parents fail to do.Yo. this might be the cause, many parents fail to use the safety seats properly.My answer is E.

(C) suggests that ""even if nuclear waste sites were certain to pose no threat, there would STILL be good reasons for putting them in sparse rather than dense areas"".===other answers(A), (B), and (D) are all strengthening the argument by agreeing with the author that the reasons for favoring sparse over dense areas for nuclear waste sites include the possibly of an accident (i.e., these answers suggest that waste sites DO pose some threat to people living nearby)(D) is technically out of scope, but the gist of it is still in line with how (A) and (B) work.(E) also seems to strengthen the argument, if anything. It means something slightly different from the 2nd sentence of the stimulus, but it's very close in agreeing with the author's overall sentiment.

Until there is no shred of doubt that nuclear dumps are safe, it makes sense to situate them where they pose the least threat to the public.stengthener We are looking for the another reason why the policy makers insist on dumping in sparse population area besides the safety issue to weaken that argument that policy makers are purely concerned about safety when they dump nuclear waste in sparse population area. C is the only answer that provide with an alternative reason. Official Explanation from Powerscore:Weaken-CE. The correct answer choice is (C).This is a Weaken question with a heavy Causal element, so let's start by examining the argument in the stimulus, finding the conclusion, and then discussing the cause and effect relationship(s) present.The author begins by introducing what is said to be a common claim: dumping of nuclear waste poses no threat to people living nearby. Typically when a stimulus begins with a belief attributed to some group the author will proceed to argue that that belief is incorrect, and that's exactly what occurs here.The next sentence begins the author's counterargument, stating that if the claims of safety could be made with certainty then nuclear waste would (or at least could) be dumped in areas of dense population. However, the policy of dumping nuclear waste only in sparsely populated regions indicates that at least some misgivings exist among policy makers about how safe that waste is.Note the causality here: the author has observed an occurrence--the dumping of nuclear waste only in more sparely populated regions--and concluded its cause, that dumping that waste in densely populated areas would pose a threat to the people living there.Cause: Nuclear waste is dangerous (i.e. People's safety) / Effect: Dumping nuclear waste away from peopleWe're asked to weaken this relationship, and as is often the case with Weaken questions and Causality, the most powerful way to do it is to introduce any alternate cause that could also lead to the observed effect. Here the author is arguing for safety as the cause, so if we can show any other reason besides safety for dumping waste in sparsely populated areas we'd seriously undermine that belief.Answer choice (A): This is about the safety of people in the event of an accident and how evacuations are more likely to fail with large populations, meaning it strengthens the argument! It gives further evidence that safety is in fact the cause, which is what the author has concluded.Answer choice (B): Again, another strengthening answer supporting the idea that safety concerns are the reason for dumping nuclear waste away from densely populated areas. This is precisely what we DON'T want to show.Answer choice (C): This is the correct answer choice. Here we're given an alternate cause to safety as the reason for dumping waste in sparsely populated areas: fewer economic and bureaucratic problems. That is, it's not safety that's behind the dumping decisions, it's money and legislative/bureaucratic headaches. This is classic Weaken-Causality at work.Answer choice (D): This is perhaps less helpful than (A) and (B), but it still provides some support to the author's position. If chemical waste is treated similarly to nuclear waste (dumped away from people), and chemical waste is known to be dangerous, then it stands to reason that safety/danger concerns are driving the dumping decisions involving both. Regardless, this certainly doesn't attack the link between safety concerns and where the waste is dumped, so it doesn't weaken the argument.Answer choice (E): Once more, we're given information that agrees with the author's view. Here it's suggested that some doubts do exist about the safety of nuclear dumps, and those doubts about safety are why it's sensible to dump the waste where it poses the least threat to the public. So safety is again the reason behind the dumping practice, and the author's argument is ever so slightly helped. Vinit800HBSaren't (A) (B) and (C) all three giving us another reason for choosing to dump waste in areas that are sparsely populated? So why does C win over A and B? It is repeatedly claimed that the dumping of nuclear waste poses no threat to people living nearby. If this claim could be made with certainty, there would be no reason for not locating sites in areas of dense population. But the policy of dumping nuclear waste only in the more sparsely populated regions indicates, at the very least, some misgiving about safety on the part of those responsible for policy.Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument?The argument is based on a hypothetical(not in reality as assumed by author if so) situation that with certainty in claim the possibility exists for locating sites in densely populated areas. On one side there's this safety issue that is claimed and on the contrary in reality such thing don't happen - dumping of nuclear waste at densely populated areas.A. Evacuation plans in the event of an accidentcould not be guaranteed to work perfectly except where the population is small. - WRONG. Touches rightly upon areas of concern but eventually it strengthens the case since claim is made as if there's certainty but in reality dumping happens in sparsely populated areas.B. In the event of an accident,it is certain that fewer people would be harmedin a sparsely populated than in a densely populated area. - WRONG. Strengthens only. Even if claim says so that there's no threat to people, some people would still be harmed in the event of accident.C. Dumping of nuclear waste poses fewer economic and bureaucratic problems in sparsely populated than in densely populated areas. - CORRECT. Gives an alternative reason for why dumping is done in sparsely populated areas. Its funny that this can't again be point towards misgiving about safety since safety of people is ignored by policy to choose economic and bureaucratic reasons.D. There are dangers associated withchemical waste, and it, too, is dumped away from areas of dense population. - WRONG. Out of scope. Irrelevant.E. Until there is no shred of doubt that nuclear dumps are safe, it makes sense to situate them where they pose the least threat to the public. - WRONG. Again kind of similar to A and B.Answer C._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

In order to weaken the honey production we would have to say that ornamental trees being less pollinated somehow results in less collection and then in less honey storage and less honey production._________________My Stuff:Four Years to 760|MBA Trends for Indian ApplicantsMy GMAT ResourcesV30-V40: How to do it!|GMATPrep SC|GMATPrep CR|GMATPrep RC|Critical Reasoning Megathread|CR: Numbers and Statistics|CR: Weaken|CR: Strengthen|CR: Assumption|SC: Modifier|SC: Meaning|SC: SV Agreement|RC: Primary Purpose|PS/DS: Numbers and Inequalities|PS/DS: Combinatorics and CoordinatesMy MBA ResourcesEverything about the MBA Application|Over-Represented MBA woes|Fit Vs Rankings|Low GPA: What you can do|Letter of Recommendation: The Guide|Indian B Schools accepting GMAT score|Why MBA?My ReviewsHow I got into five schools from zero - Applicant Lab ReviewVeritas Prep Live OnlineSignature Read More Not clear - can be B or C.Firstly the question asks us to either find a ""strengthen answer"" or identify an ""out of scope answer"". Also it asks to provide atleast one reason to differ from its conclusion that domestic commercial honey production will not decline in the United States if local honeybees are displaced by Africanized honeybees.A. Weakens the argument. The assumption in the argument is that Brazilian native honey bees and American commercial native honey bees are of similar variety and thus the production output can be compared. This answer clearly weaken the argument by stating that the bees are not of the same variety. So the production can be same, lower or higher than the Brazilian bees. We cant clearly agree with the statement's conclusionB. Seems out of scope to me. This answer can weaken the argument only if there is any validation to correlate expensive and complicated honey production with the decline in honey production. There is no clear explanation in the premise of the argument to validate this.C. Seems out of scope to me. Again this answer can weaken the argument only if there is indication that ornamental trees are the key player in US honey production. Also the argument needs to provide validity that ""Certain "" type of ornamental trees mentioned in the answer play important role in the honey production in US. There is no clarity for the above point in the premise.D. Weaken the argument. This answer clearly states the impact created by the change from local bees to africanised bees and clearly states that major proportion of honey producers will abandon and thus will reduce the production outputE. Weakens the argument. The assumption in the argument is that habits of Brazilian native honey bees and American commercial native honey bees are of similar nature and thus the production output can be compared. This answer clearly weaken the argument by stating that the habits of the bees are not comparable. So the production can be same, lower or higher than the Brazilian bees. We cant clearly agree with the statement's conclusionHence B OR C for me. Please explain? The question asks which would not weaken the statement ""do not fear that commercial honey production declines...""(A) The honeybees native to Brazil are not of the same variety as those most frequently used in the commercial beekeeping industry in the United States.>> weakens the statement because if they are not same, the study will not hold good in United States.(B) Commercial honey production is far more complicated and expensive with Africanized honeybees than it is with the more docile honeybees common in the United States.>> weakens the statement if the production becomes expensive there is a chance that less production will happen.(C) If Africanized honeybees replace local honeybees, certain types of ornamental trees will be less effectively pollinated.>> Will not effect the argument.(D) In the United States a significant proportion of the commercial honey supply comes from hobby beekeepers, many of whom are likely to abandon beekeeping with the influx of Africanized bees.>> Weakens the argument as if beekeeping is abandoned by many, there will be less production.(E) The area of Brazil where the comparative study was done is far better suited to the foraging habits of the Africanized honeybees than are most areas of the United States.>> Weakens the argument, in this situation again this study will not hold good in United States.My answer is C. Except C every other point weakens the argument.

Weakener. HelloGMATNinjaTwoI have a query regarding this question.The answer is straightaway C since it does not affect the argument.I want to understand how does B affect the argument.Conclusion: There is no reason to fear that domestic commercial honey production will decline in the United States if local honeybees are displaced by Africanized honeybees.While B states that: (B) Commercial honey production is far more complicated and expensive with Africanized honeybees than it is with the more docile honeybees common in the United States.If US does not have the resources or the budget aligned for this project, then definitely it could affect overall honey production. On the other hand, if it can afford the same, then maybe there is a probability that production could increase?My understanding is that: it draws on incorrect comparison (related to species and operating conditions) to draw a conclusion. How does B help to weaken the argument? In Brazil, side-by-side comparisons of Africanized honeybees and the native honeybees have shown that the Africanized bees are far superior honey producers. Therefore, there is no reason to fear that domestic commercial honey production will decline in the United States if local honeybees are displaced by Africanized honeybees.Boil it down - there is no reason to fear that domestic commercial honey production will decline in the United States if local honeybees are displaced by Africanized honeybees.Each of the following, if true, would weaken the argument EXCEPT:(A) The honeybees native to Brazil are not of the same variety as those most frequently used in the commercial beekeeping industry in the United States.-- Weakens --The author depends on the assumption that native Brazilian HB are the same as native U.S(B) Commercial honey production is far more complicated and expensive with Africanized honeybees than it is with the more docile honeybees common in the United States.-- Weakens  -- points out a factor other than superior honey production that possibly affects the commercial honey production(C) If Africanized honeybees replace local honeybees, certain types of ornamental trees will be less effectively pollinated. -- Correct -- certain is too vague -These certain types of trees may only make up 1% of the sources these bees collect from or it may not even be the type these bees use.(D) In the United States a significant proportion of the commercial honey supply comes from hobby beekeepers, many of whom are likely to abandon beekeeping with the influx of Africanized bees. -- Weakens --(E) The area of Brazil where the comparative study was done is far better suited to the foraging habits of the Africanized honeybees than are most areas of the United States.-- Weakens -- makes a distinction between the two environments that the author assumes to be similar or overlooks details from the twoAnswer C I know I am very late to contribute in the thread, but here is my understanding-In Brazil, side-by-side comparisons of Africanized honeybees and the native honeybees have shown that the Africanized bees are far superior honey producers.

Photovoltaic power plants produce electricity from sunlight. As a result of astonishing recent technological advances, the cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic power plants, allowing for both construction and operating costs, is one-tenth of what it was 20 years ago, whereas the corresponding cost for traditional plants, which burn fossil fuels, has increased.

If you are not taking the LSAT, please stay away from this question as it will only confuse you.Here is an explanation from Powerscore:https://forum.powerscore.com/lsat/viewtopic.php?t=9113nightblade354Useful contribution but I still have following in the explanation provided. I posting the explanation here for continuity in the forum discussion.On a number of occasions the correct answer to a Justify question has been something that is also an Assumption of the argument (and vice versa). The difference is that Justify answers can also contain elements that are not necessary to the argument. It just depends on what the test makers decide to do.Turning to the problem at hand, this is one that I've always liked, primarily because I feel as though it's a great example of how topic can influence our analysis. Most students, when they see ""photovoltaic power plants,"" kind of go into a fugue state and just disconnect from the problem. I used to joke in class that if this question was about cheeseburgers or diamonds (things that people are familiar with), everyone would get it right. Let's analogize it and see:Kobe beef has traditionally been one of the most expensive forms of protein in the world. As a result of advancements in farming and production, Kobe beef now costs 1/10 of what it did 20 years ago. Traditional cheeseburgers, on the other hand, have become slightly more expensive. Thus, Kobe beef is now a cheaper way to get protein than a traditional cheeseburger.Or, let's say it was about diamonds:Diamonds have traditionally been one of the most expensive gems in the world. As a result of advancements in production, diamonds now costs 1/10 of what they did 20 years ago. Cubic zirconia, a synthetic form of diamond, on the other hand, have become slightly more expensive. Thus, diamonds are now cheaper than cubic zirconia.These two examples may make the problem clearer: even though the expensive item has dropped in price, that doesn't now mean it is less expensive than the originally cheaper alternative. If a diamond used to cost $1000 and a cubic zirconia cost $10, even when the diamond is 1/10 the price ($100), it is still more expensive than the cubic zirconia.In this light, answer choice (D) suddenly makes a lot more sense, because it addresses the initial price difference, and shows that when you drop the price to 1/10, it would belower than the other item.This last statement does not agree with numbers mentioned above in the explanation.i.e. explanation does not make choice D) clear winner.......Will like to have your take on this.... Harshgmat,That is the point. Justify questions are more like strengthen/weaken questions. We just want to fill the missing piece of information. In this example, the missing information was original cost. We do not care about future cost because the question is exclusively about the present. Is it a perfect question? Nope, as your math shows. But (D) is the best answer given the circumstances._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses. Go:HereWant to know your Business School chances?

OFFICIAL ANSWER:As the argument is stated, there is a logical gap between the information given in the premises and the claim made in the conclusion:Premise 1: The cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic power plants is one-tenth of what it was 20 years ago.Premise 2: The corresponding cost for traditional plants has increased.Conclusion: Photovoltaic power plants offer a less expensive approach to meeting demand for electricity than do traditional power plants.From the fact that one cost has gone down while another has risen, it does not necessarily follow that the first is now lower than the second. In particular, if the cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic power plants twenty years ago was more than ten times the corresponding cost for traditional plants, then the fact that it is now one-tenth what it was is not sufficient to show that it is now lower than the corresponding cost for traditional plants, even though we are told in Premise 2 that the cost for traditional plants has increased. To conclude from the premises given in the argument that photovoltaic power plants now offer a less expensive approach than do traditional power plants, we need to know how the costs of the two methods of production were related 20 years ago—specifically that the cost of producing power at photovoltaic plants was less than 10 times the cost of producing it at traditional plants. (D) gives this information and is, thus, the credited response.Response (A) is incorrect because it tells us about only one of the two costs, not about how the two were related 20 years ago. It in effect restates premise 2, and premises 1 and 2 together are not sufficient for drawing the conclusion.Response (B) is incorrect. The amount of electricity produced by the different kinds of plants is not at issue.Response (C) is incorrect. While it is relevant to the discussion, (C) does not provide the information about the comparative costs of the two kinds of plants 20 years ago that allows the conclusion to be properly drawn.Response (E) is incorrect because the conclusion in the argument is about the present only. Whether or not the change described in (E) is expected to take place has no bearing on the claim in the conclusion that the one kind of plant offers a less expensive approach at present.OPTION:D GMATNinjaplease explain this question, I am not able to understand it nightblade354This is a JUSTIFY question and not an assumption question.

There's a risk in assuming that ""healthier diets"" have low cholesterol level.B) Correct. In order to reach conclusion, assuming that Western Diets result in higher blood cholesterol levels than do non-Western diets closes the gap left by the premises.

"The high cost of productions is severely limiting which operas are available to the public.

We evaluating whether denying them the ABILITY to sponsor would result in the public seeing less famous operas.I agree that (C) at first feels like cheating ... are we just denying the IF condition from the conclusion?Not really. The IF condition from the conclusion is that production budgets would be lowered so that box-office and private donations can cover it. Let's say, to make this more concrete, that we only take in $50,000 per show from box-office and private donations.Fine, then our production budget is set at $50,000. Will we now be staging less famous operas?No, according to (C). The only operas we could afford without corporate sponsors will be the most famous of operas. So, according to (C) our $50,000 budget will only help us to produce the most famous of operas.What's hard about interpreting this answer choice correctly is how counterintuitive it seems to me: it's essentially implying that the most famous operas are cheaper to produce than less famous operas are.(I tend to assume the opposite, even though there's no reason more famous has to mean more expensive.)As a more general rule of thumb, if you're trying to weaken an argument that's expressed in conditional form ...IF we do this thing, THEN we get this result... the test will almost always weaken it with an answer that shows ""even if you do this thing, you still WON'T get the result you're seeking"".So I was reading answers looking for, ""Which one tells me that, following our plan, we WON'T get less famous operas?""Seen in this light, only (C) is relevant. None of the others even discuss how famous the operas will be.(D) We don't care whether large corporate sponsors will or will not support opera productions. The conclusion is conditional, IF budgets can be reduced to the point where there is no need to rely on large corporate sponsors THEN ...(E) Makes the same mistake as (D). Even if individuals can't match the donations of corporate sponsors, individuals might be able to cover all costs IF production budgets are reduced. The high cost of productions is severely limiting which operas are available to the public. These costs necessitate reliance on large corporate sponsors, who in return demand that only the most famous operas be produced. Determining which operas will be produced should rest only with ticket purchasers at the box office, not with large corporate sponsors. If we reduce production budgets so that operas can be supported exclusively by box-office receipts and donations from individuals, then the public will be able to see less famous operas.Which one of the following, if true, would weaken the argument?------------------------Prethinking gives us assumpion that in order  to weaken the argument we have to find an option, that says that this("" operas can be supported exclusively by box-office receipts and donations from individuals"") will be not enough.It is one of the few questions where the right answer just jumps in fron of you.(A) A few ticket purchasers go to the opera for the sake of going to the opera, not to see specific operatic productions.Out of scope. It does not say anything about he link between individual donations an production of operas(B) The reduction of opera production budgets would not reduce the desire of large corporate sponsors to support operas.Ok, maybe. Still nothing about the link. Moreover. If production's costs are reduced, people will likely see more operas (so it is a strenghethener)(C) Without the support of large corporate sponsors, opera companies could not afford to produce any but the most famous of operas.That is it. The righr answer, that jumps at us.Corporate sponsors are out. So we have only individual sponsors. And money from them will not be enough for less famous operas and even for some of the most famous operas. So peeople will see fewer operas. Weakening.(D) Large corporate sponsors will stop supporting opera productions if they are denied control over which operas will be produced.Gives uds nothing. Ok, they will stop, but maybe there will be enough financial support from individual sponcors(E) The combination of individual donations and box-office receipts cannot match the amounts of money obtained through sponsorship by large corporations.Sounds like it true.

Not able to understand the solution given.GMATNinjanightblade354.Please guide. aarti0312, let's break down the question:The high cost of productions is severely limiting which operas are available to the public. These costs necessitate reliance on large corporate sponsors, who in return demand that only the most famous operas be produced. Determining which operas will be produced should rest only with ticket purchasers at the box office, not with large corporate sponsors. If we reduce production budgets so that operas can be supported exclusively by box-office receipts and donations from individuals, then the public will be able to see less famous operas.P1: The high cost of productions is severely limiting which operas are available to the publicP2: These costs necessitate reliance on large corporate sponsors, who in return demand that only the most famous operas be producedP3: Determining which operas will be produced should rest only with ticket purchasers at the box office, not with large corporate sponsorsC: If we reduce production budgets so that operas can be supported exclusively by box-office receipts and donations from individuals, then the public will be able to see less famous operasOK, so this is an interesting set up. We are told that something costs a lot to produce. Further, we are told that in order to meet these costs, we must use outside help. But these outsiders want to control what we see. It is then proposed that we reduce these high costs so we can see less famous operas. WHAT? There is a gigantic assumption being made here, and if you miss it then you are probably going to get stuck with (E), which is truly wrong. The major issue at hand is whether famous operas cost less. Do they? Maybe less famous operas cost more because they need specialized items that are not in some of the most common operas. From this argument we could logically conclude that less budget = less outside help. But this conclusion is a stretch. We need to find something that looks like this or weakens the argument in another area. I doubt the LSAT will divert from the line of thinking above, but let's find out.Which one of the following, if true, would weaken the argument?(A) A few ticket purchasers go to the opera for the sake of going to the opera, not to see specific operatic productions. --Who cares about the motive? Are they still going? They are still going to see big or small operas supposedly, so this doesn't weaken our argument. In fact, it might strengthen it in some respect. Either way, out.(B) The reduction of opera production budgets would not reduce the desire of large corporate sponsors to support operas. --Who cares about the desire of the corporations? Do they still give money? Do we still listen to them? Do they force us to make big operas? We have no clue because we do not care about who wants what. Out.(C) Without the support of large corporate sponsors, opera companies could not afford to produce any but the most famous of operas. --Bingo, this is our weakener. Word for word what we were looking for. The LSAT plays on the idea that big operas are more expensive, but is this necessarily true? Not in the LSAT world (or the real world for that matter). If this were true, then our argument is gone. Perfect.(D) Large corporate sponsors will stop supporting opera productions if they are denied control over which operas will be produced. --Does this weaken anything? Nope. This just says that one of our assumptions is correct: That no money = no say. But this doesn't do anything for our argument that we want small time opera and smaller budgets.(E) The combination of individual donations and box-office receipts cannot match the amounts of money obtained through sponsorship by large corporations. --The trap answer choice for those who get to (E) and assume that it is correct. But think about it. Do we really care that they do not match the corporations? What if we came up one cent short. Does this stop the opera? And once more, we want to put on small-time operas, so does budget match that? It could. This is a great trap answer choice if you do not understand the argument._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

This information doesn't help us to prove the fact that watching less TV -> children will do well in maths.(C) Children who want to do well in advanced measurement and geometry will watch less than television.- We need to prove :  watching less TV -> children will do well in maths.So, this is just the opposite.(D) A child's ability in advanced measurement and geometry increases if he or she watches less than one hour of television a day.- The premise says about children who watches TV for 5 hrs. We can not prove the conclusion using this piece of information.(E) The instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States in not substantially worse than that available to South Korea children.- Ok, the author here used a technique to falsify a scenario that could have hurt our conclusion.Negating this , will hurt the conclusion.Assuming that the students of USA and South Korea have similar potential to grasp knowledge, if the concepts available to the students of USA are not as good as that of South Korea, the conclusion may not be always true.So, E, IMO is the correct answer. EB is a good distraction. Out of scope though, close but not close enough.Pattern: Another way? broallThe more television children watch, the less competent they are in mathematical knowledge.

If the conclusion were changed as you suggested, then choice (E) would very clearly be a required assumption.As for the given conclusion, the word ""must"" is very important. The author is implying thattelevisionis the problem in the US. If the kids in the US would watch less television, then they would do well in math.In order for this reasoning to hold, we have to assume that there are no other obstacles preventing the US children from doing well in math. But what if, for example, the instruction in those concepts is really bad in the US? In that case, reducing television watching might not be enough to cause those children to do well. The first sentence suggests that they might do a bitbetter, but they still might not dowell.Furthermore, if the instructional materials/methods themselves are bad, then it'spossiblethat the children would do better if they simply had better materials/methods. Maybe they could continue watching 5 hours of television per day and still do pretty well if the instruction were improved.The author's logic is only valid if we assume that the quality of the instruction available to US children is close to that of the instruction available to SK children. Choice (E) is a more obvious assumption if we change the conclusion, as noted bySkywalker18, but as is choice (E) is still the best answer.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More DavidTutorexamPALGMATNinjanightblade354gmat1393AjiteshArunSkywalker18VeritasKarishmaWhy D is wrong ?I rejected it because E sounded more good to me but I want to know the exact reason why it is wrong teaserbaeDavidTutorexamPALGMATNinjanightblade354gmat1393AjiteshArunSkywalker18VeritasKarishmaWhy D is wrong ?I rejected it because E sounded more good to me but I want to know the exact reason why it is wrongD is primarily wrong becauseit is not an assumption -it is the argument!.The claim is that mathematical knowledge is hurt by TV watching; D merely restates this, in a more detailed way. But an assumption has to be separate than the claim itself.Another reason is that, in being more specific, D is actually not essential. An assumption must be true in order for an argument to be true; in other words,it is impossible that the argument is true and the assumption isn't. this simply isn't the case here: it is clearly possible that TV hurts math knowledge in general, but that being 59 minutes or 61 minutes doesn't matter at all: in other words, that the claim in D is not true. Try the negation method- negate each option and check whether conclusion holds or not.If you negate the correct option, the conclusion also fails.Example- In option E- The instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States isnotsubstantially worse than that available to South Korea children.Now negate the option - The instruction in advanced measurement and geometric concepts available to children in the United States is substantially worse than that available to South Korea children.So it tells us that USA children are not performing well because of poor teaching as compared to South Korea and not because of TVs.So conclusion does not hold good.So E is the correct answer. rohanraleYour answer seems to be the most easiest so far to understand.Is it preferable to use the negation technique (negate the answer choice to check if the conclusion holds) to answer most of the assumption questions?Or would you suggest something else?

Could you please verify that my line of thought is correct?Discount from publishers --will lead to--> Below-market price sale --will lead to--> ProfitablityHigh sales volume --will lead to--> Discount from publishersEither Exclusive or a large specialized market or both --will lead to--> High sales volumeSince its clear that ""Discount from publishers"" is the only thing in the argument that will enable sellers to sale books at below-market price, Option C is correct? ( A bookstore that profitably sells books at below-market prices gets discounts from publishers.) The answer to our question is can be found straight in the text:""The only way that bookstores can profitably sell books at below-market prices is to get the books at a discount from publishers"" , every other answer choice makes assumptions based on information we do not have. pkm9995109794C looks like the premise itself.How can we call it an inference?I agree withpkm9995109794. Answer C is clearly stated in the first sentence, therefore it is the premise rather than an inference. sayiurway, inference questions, as I stated above, only need to be true. They do not need to be conclusions. The fact that you point it out in the sentence means it has to be true and means that that is, indeed, an inference. Do not confuse an inference for a conclusion.If I say, for example, bananas are yellow solely because of the sun. The conclusion = bananas are yellow; the premise: because of the sun. Now, if I say, for an answer choice, ""bananas get their color from the sun"", this has to be true. It does not matter that it is a premise. It is 100% true, albeit stupid._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses. Go:HereWant to know your Business School chances?

No individual has decision-making power in a bureaucracy.(D) The only risky projects undertaken are those for which a single individual has decision-making power.This says that risky projects are undertaken only when one individual has decision making power. Given that in a bureaucracy, no individual has decision making power, it follows then that no risky project would be undertaken. This option leads us to the conclusion.

Also, it says ""sometimes"". Also, it tells us when people take more risks as individuals than they would in a group. But it doesn't tell us that groups DO NOT take risks.

The language of the premises and conclusion suggests that theassumption should not merely be a generalisationand thatthe assumption should have a closer to extreme language, since the conclusion has that.A) All projects in a bureaucracy require risk. -Incorrect. This wouldn't help the premise because it doesn't talk about all projects undertaken by bureaucracy, but only about bureaucracies' attitude towards risky projects.(B) Decisive individuals choose not to work in a bureaucracy. -Incorrect. This would be too extreme. Again assuming this would make us conclude that no projects are undertaken in bureaucracies.(C) An individual who has decision-making power will take risks. -Close, but incorrect. The language is too generalised. We are concerned with risky projects and not just risks.(D) The only risky projects undertaken are those for which a single individual has decision-making power. -Correct. If we negate this statement, it would mean that there are a few risky projects which could be undertaken by deciding within the group. Therefore, it discounts the conclusion.(E) People sometimes take risks as individuals that they would not take as part of a group. -Close, but incorrect. The mention of the word ""sometimes"" does not bode well with the use of the word ""never"" in conclusion.Hence, D. E is wrong because from E it follows that there can be at least two kinds of risks a)  risks that people take as individuals but not in groups. b) risks that people would not take as individuals but may take as part of a group. Argument: In bureaucracy, ALL decisions... involve many people.Option D talks about single individual taking decision.It contradicts the argument and our premises, isn't it? So how is it correct? RiyaJain69Argument: In bureaucracy, ALL decisions... involve many people.Option D talks about single individual taking decision.It contradicts the argument and our premises, isn't it? So how is it correct?Option (D) talks about risky projects in general, not in a bureaucracy.It says that risky projects are undertaken when only one person takes the decision.In a bureaucracy, many people are involved in decision making.Hence, it stands to reason that a risky project will not be undertaken in a bureaucracy._________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

"Oil analysts predict that if the price of oil falls by half, the consumer's purchase price for gasoline made from this oil will also fall by half.Which one of the following, if true, would cast the most serious doubt on the prediction made by the oil analysts?(A) Improved automobile technology and new kinds of fuel for cars have enabled some drivers to use less gasoline.(B) Gasoline manufacturers will not expand their profit margins.(C) There are many different gasoline companies that compete with each other to provide the most attractive price to consumers.(D) Studies in several countries show that the amount of gasoline purchased by consumers initially rises after the price of gasoline has fallen.(E) Refining costs, distribution costs, and taxes, none of which varies significantly with oil prices, constitute a large portion of the price of gasoline.ShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","E would be my choice - states that gasoline prices are not diectly proportional to oil prices and that there are several other costs besides the oil price factor. E with the crowdIn a simple scenario, if oil price is 10$ and taxes are at 5$, consumer will pay 15$If oil price drops to 5$ but taxes remain at 5$, then consumer pays 10$ which is not half of 15$ Why not (B). If the company expands its profit margin, then consumer wil pay more even if the oil prices drop.In (E), even though the manufacturing cost varies with oil prices, it is still subjected to the assumption that the oil company does not want to expand its profit. E.B actually strengthens the argument. If the manufacturers do not expand profit and keep the same profit margin then we can reasonably conclude that the gasoline price will fall with oil pricesActually B says that ""willnotexpand"". I think, ywilfred you read it otherwise. Lets go with some  numbers  hereAssume  price  of  gasoline  = price of  oil  + taxes/other  costs  +  profit  margins.  Let  me put  some  numbers  here...so we have 100 = 50 + 25 +25- Margin is 50%(25 = 50% of 50)New No.s as per  B would be =  25+ 12.5 +12.5= 50 (12.5= 50%  of 25 )New No.s as  per E would be = 25 +25+ 12.5 = 62.5Hence  E. ywilfredWhy not (B). If the company expands its profit margin, then consumer wil pay more even if the oil prices drop.In (E), even though the manufacturing cost varies with oil prices, it is still subjected to the assumption that the oil company does not want to expand its profit.Hey,I will give it a try. Might be a stupid argument but stillConsumers purchase gasoline from companies and not from manufacturers right. So what the manufacturer does would probably not affect the consumer purchase price of gasoline.

Right ?Option E actually does not strengthen the argument hence it is the best choice.Although I am no expert I feel a better weakener would be something like ""  Refining costs, distribution costs, and taxes, increase as the  quantity of oil increases, and a drop in the price of oil, causes quantity of oil for refining and distribution to increase""Option E given as it is , could also imply that refining, distribution and taxes remain same ( does not vary ) hence if the initial manufactures purchase price of raw oil dropped then definitely the consumer purchase price of oil would also drop as the price of other factors ( such as refining, distribution and taxes ,) does not increase.

Here the option A says that there are some people who will use less gasoline. So actually this argument slightly strengthens my belief. However, this option is neither strengthen nor weakener. This is because we still do not know what the majority of people would do to increase demand or decrease demand for gasoline.GMAT says that some means at least one and thus on this basis only its tough to decide the impact of ""some"" on the conclusion.Regards,Rishav I think its E because there are fixed and variable costs in production so the fixed costs may not go down.

With assumption/strengthen/weaken questions, the main trap that you wanna avoid is to look at the options and consider whether they are true, not how they affect the argumentgiventheir truth.The conclusion that we are trying to weaken is thatconsumer's purchase price for gasoline made from this oil will also fall by half. So we want something that suggests that the consumer purchase price will not fall that much.A- If some drivers use less gasoline, it would further indicate that the price is going to fall. This strengthens the conclusion then if anything.OUTB- If gasoline manufacturers do not expand their profit margins, then it suggests they will indeed drop prices.OUTC- If there is competition, then the prices for the consumers will drop, so this doesn't work either.OUTD- A brief increase in quantity purchased does not necessarily indicate the price will be impacted in any way.OUTE- This option works because it attacks the link between the premise and conclusion. If the price of gasoline is not actually that closely linked to the price of oil, then it would not drop just because the price of oil dropped.CORRECT- Matoo_________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More Hey,I am wondering if E is right.

No impact. Irrelevant.(B) Gasoline manufacturers will not expand their profit margins. - WRONG. Supports somehow but depends on what assumptions we make.(C) There are many different gasoline companies that compete with each other to provide the most attractive price to consumers. - WRONG. No impact. Irrelevant.(D) Studies in several countries show that the amount of gasoline purchased by consumers initially rises after the price of gasoline has fallen. - WRONG. No impact. Irrelevant.(E) Refining costs, distribution costs, and taxes, none of which varies significantly with oil prices. constitute a large portion of the prices of gasoline. - CORRECT. So, these costs would almost remain same thus, only the material price drops by half. This eventually suggests if 100 is the price price which drops to 50, the initial consumer's price being 140 just drops to may be 85, wherein 60 is fixed cost. So, the customer pays 85 which is more than half.Answer E._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More",https://gmatclub.com/forum/oil-analysis-predict-that-if-the-price-of-oil-fails-by-half-8968.html

This choice does not comment on S1 or S2B) Incorrect - The animals that fed large doses of synthetic fat shown symptoms of acute W. So this choice confirms that at least in animals reducing blood fat level may help prevent acute W. However we are not sure whether the same is true with humans. Moreover this choice does not explain why S2 is trueC) Correct - This choice provides the reason that why both the paradoxically statement are true.During progress from latent to acute W, disease causing agents absorb most of the fat from blood. So blood fat level of acute W patient must be low since most of the fat has already been absorbed by disease causing agents. If a normal person has low blood fat level then disease causing agent may not be able to progress and hence low blood fat level can prevent acute W.D) Incorrect - This choice only partially agrees with S1E) Incorrect - IrrelevantNarenn In a resolve the paradox question, the answer choice must not address only one of the elements of the paradox but clearly explain as to why there was a transition from x=>y thereby causing the paradox whilst both X and Y hold true.

Where did that come from?Now, you raise an interesting concern about whether the kids are actually using the words correctly, or ""appropriately"" (as (D) says). But the premise says that the kids are using the words to convey things that ""they are obviously experiencing."" If they kids are in fact experiencing the feeling/emotion, then they would be using the word correctly/appropriately!Okay, so in this core, we have kids who both 1) can't explain emotion-words and 2) use emotion-words correctly in reference to their experiences. From the, the author decides that understanding doesn't necessarily require being able to explain. In other words, these kids must be evidence for how one can show understanding, despite not being able to explain!The author must be assuming that this situation is evidence of ""understanding"" - otherwise, this argument makes no sense! So, why does the author think the kids have understanding? The only relevant premise is the fact that the kids use the words. Those are the two ideas we need to connect!If [using a word to convey real experience] always meant that you had [understanding], then these kids would have understanding. And since they can't explain the words, they would be prime examples of people who had understanding, and yet couldn't explain the words. This would support the conclusion that understanding does NOT depend on the ability to explain - these kids prove it!This is precisely what (D) gives us. Nothing in it strays too far from the argument. We know from the premises that children use the words to express things they are ""obviously experiencing"", so that matches ""appropriately uses a word"". Now, we DON'T know that these children understand - that's the very thing we are trying to support!! If (D) is true, then the kids in the stimulus WOULD understand!The correct answer here, as principle (support) answers often do, connects an idea in the premise to an idea in the conclusion in a conditional language format. (IF [premise-idea], THEN [conclusion-idea]).Let's take a quick spin through the incorrect answers:(A) First, the argument never said that explaining words was difficult for most people, just most children. But more importantly, we aren't trying to support a conclusion that some kids CAN explain - rather that understanding may not require explaining.(B) Now, this taps into the idea of ""understanding"", which we know we want. And it's a conditional statement that gets me to that goal! But this conditional is triggered when someone CAN provide an explanation of a word - and our kids can't do that. So, this doesn't help us show that these kids have understanding!(C) The scope of the definition of the words is not relevant. This might explain WHY kids have trouble explaining them, but that doesn't help us get from premise to conclusion. Premise explainers don't help!(E) Another premise explainer! This conditional translates to: If [words can be explained], then [words about see/touch]. This explains why those abstract words are hard for kids to explain, but doesn't help us prove that any understanding is going on! Most children find it very difficult to explain exactly what the words they use mean when those words do not refer to things that can be seen or touched. Yet since children are able to use these words to convey the feelings and emotions they are obviously experiencing, understanding what a word means clearly does not depend on being able to explain it.Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would provide the most justification for the conclusion?(A) The fact that a task is very difficult for most people does not mean that no one can do it. -We are not talking about a difficult task.(B) Anyone who can provide an exact explanation of a word has a clear understanding of what that word means.  -This is the opposite of the premise(C) Words that refer to emotions invariably have less narrowly circumscribed conventional meanings than do word that refer to physical objects. -We are not comparing the meanings of different variety of words(D) When someone appropriately uses a word to convey something that he or she is experiencing, that person understands what that word mean.  -Correct.

As the passage says that the level of carbon will be maintained by nature.(B) It is not clear that breathing excess carbon in the atmosphere will have a negative effect on human life.Breathing excess carbon in atmosphere will have -ve effect on human life. So, it surely is a problem. But if nature will maintain the level of carbon in atmosphere, there won't be any problem. This doesn't weaken the conclusion.(C) Carbon is part of the chemical “blanket” that keeps the Earth warm enough to sustain human life.This is again a fact but it doesn't weaken the conclusion.(D) Breathing by animals releases almost 30 times as much carbon as does the burning of fossil fuels.Breathing by animals releases almost 30 times as much carbon as by burning the fossil fuel. But it is happening from ages. Only extra burden is created by the burning of fossil fuel and hence it has created problem. So this statement is out of scope.(E) The natural adjustment process, which occurs over millions of years, allows wide fluctuations in the carbon level in the short term.Now this point really weakens the conclusion. Since nature adjustment process will take million years and hence short term fluctuation in carbon level is allowed by nature. So, during that time, the increased level of carbon in nature will threaten human life & hence environmentalists should not relax.So, my answer is E. Waiting for OA to be posted. broallNature constantly adjusts the atmospheric carbon level.

As mentioned before, to weaken an argument typically you attack a premise (either expressed or suppressed) of the argument. Now someone who did not fully understand the author’s main point might mistake the counter-premise for a premise. Look at answer choice (B); it directly attacks the counter-premise by implying that it may not be true. The LSAT writers offer (B) as bait. They know that some people will fall for it because it attacks a statement in the argument, as should the answer. The best answer, however, will attack the main premise.One possibility the author did not account for is that the natural adjustment process may require many years and that in the short run dangerous levels of carbon could accumulate. This directly attacks the main premise of the argument, “Natureconstantlyadjusts the atmospheric carbon level.”Hence the answer is (E).It is often clarifying to outline an argument’s logical structure. An outline can make clear the argumentative strategy the author is using. The above argument has the following structure:Main PremiseExplanation of Main PremiseSecondary PremiseCounter-PremiseConclusionThe first sentence introduces the main premise that nature constantly adjusts the atmospheric carbon level. The next three sentences explain that premise. Then in the fifth sentence, the secondary premise is introduced that environmentalists are concerned that burning fossil fuels may increase atmospheric carbon to dangerous levels. Then the penultimate (next to last) sentence introduces the counter-premise that an increase in the carbon level would be a threat to human life. This measures the conclusion that environmentalists should relax because nature will adjust the carbon level._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More broallNature constantly adjusts the atmospheric carbon level. An increase in the level causes the atmosphere to hold more heat, which causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes increased rain. Rain washes some carbon from the air into the oceans, where it eventually becomes part of the seabed. A decrease in atmospheric carbon causes the atmosphere to hold less heat, which causes decreased evaporation from the oceans, which causes less rain, and thus less carbon is washed into the oceans. Yet some environmentalists worry that burning fossil fuels may raise atmospheric carbon to a dangerous level. It is true that a sustained increase would threaten human life. But the environmentalists should relax—nature will continually adjust the carbon level.Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument in the passage?(A) Plant life cannot survive without atmospheric carbon.(B) It is not clear that breathing excess carbon in the atmosphere will have a negative effect on human life.(C) Carbon is part of the chemical “blanket” that keeps the Earth warm enough to sustain human life.(D) Breathing by animals releases almost 30 times as much carbon as does the burning of fossil fuels.(E) The natural adjustment process, which occurs over millions of years, allows wide fluctuations in the carbon level in the short term.Source: LSATE.The author concludes that environmentalists are wrong to worry about increased carbon levels due to the burning of fossil fuels, because nature will continually adjust the carbon level. However, if, as choice (E) states, the adjustment process works very slowly, allowing wide short-term fluctuations in the carbon level, then it’s conceivable that dangerous or even lethal levels of carbon can build up, thus severely weakening the author’s argument: the environmentalists would be right to worry.(A), (C) The author doesn’t debate the necessity of carbon, she merely argues that nature takes care of the carbon level by itself, and that the environmentalists should chill.(B) Some may feel that this weakens the author’s concession in the last sentence, but even if it did, that sentence is basically a tangential point that has little todo with the logic of the argument, which deals with nature’s regulation of the carbon level. However, this probably doesn’t even affect the author’s concession, because that statement never said or implied that the threat to humans of increased carbon levels would come from breathing it in; it would likely be more indirect, along the lines of the processes described.(D) This is an irrelevant comparison that has no bearing on the logic of the argument. Nature constantly adjusts the atmospheric carbon level. An increase in the level causes the atmosphere to hold more heat, which causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes increased rain. Rain washes some carbon from the air into the oceans, where it eventually becomes part of the seabed. A decrease in atmospheric carbon causes the atmosphere to hold less heat, which causes decreased evaporation from the oceans, which causes less rain, and thus less carbon is washed into the oceans. Yet some environmentalists worry that burning fossil fuels may raise atmospheric carbon to a dangerous level. It is true that a sustained increase would threaten human life. But the environmentalists should relax—nature will continually adjust the carbon level.Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument in the passage?(A) Plant life cannot survive without atmospheric carbon. - WRONG. Plain generic statement that passage is not about.(B) It is not clear that breathing excess carbon in the atmosphere will have a negative effect on human life. - WRONG. Scope shift. Not impacting passage.(C) Carbon is part of the chemical “blanket” that keeps the Earth warm enough to sustain human life. - WRONG. That we already know from the passage.(D) Breathing by animals releases almost 30 times as much carbon as does the burning of fossil fuels. - WRONG. So, its a natures part only thus a strengthener.(E) The natural adjustment process, which occurs over millions of years, allows wide fluctuations in the carbon level in the short term. - CORRECT. If adjustment occurs for a longer period of time as compared to fluctuation that may lead to extreme situation then there is trouble.Answer E._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Perhaps the public-private pay gap will stay positive but constant. This does not destroy the argument: there still may be a need for government action to close the pay gap to zero. Thus, by the Assumption Negation test, this answer choice is not correct.Answer choice (D): This is the correct answer choice. Assume the logical opposite of this statement: What if people who moved from government jobs to private-sector jobs would not choose to change careers back to government jobs? If so, the author's argument will totally fail. Thus, by the Assumption Negation test, the statement contained in this answer choice is absolutely necessary for the argument.Answer choice (E): There is no mention of what would happen if the public-private pay gap increases, rather than shrinks in the argument. So, this is irrelevant. VeritasKarishmaRohitSalujavikasp99Because a large disparity in pay between the public and private sectors has developed in recent years, many experienced and extremely capable government administrators have quit their posts and taken positions in private-sector management.

The focus of the argument is on 'capable administrators'.

Insurance company regulations that deny coverage for certain laboratory tests therefore decrease the quality of medical care provided to patients.Lab tests help in improving the diagnosis. But since insurance companies deny such tests the argument concludes that medical care will deteriorateQuote:(A) Physical examinations and the uncovered laboratory tests together provide a more accurate diagnosis of many diseases than do physical examinations alone.If physical tests alone could provide diagnosis then insurance regulation wouldn’t be interfering with the diagnosis since that would suggest that lab tests are indeed unnecessary. However, if the statement is taken as is then it would help in filling the gapQuote:(B) Many physicians generally oppose insurance company regulations that, in order to reduce costs, limit the use of laboratory tests.Argument is not about the physician’s choice. it is about the insurance industry’s regulations. Out of scopeQuote:(C) Many patients who might benefit from the uncovered laboratory tests do not have any form of health insurance.This would weaken the argument because if majority of patients don’t have any cover then insurance regulation won’t impact the argumentQuote:(D) There are some illnesses that experienced physicians can diagnose accurately from physicians examination alone.Some illnesses will always be there. For example anyone can catch a normal flu. Not relevantQuote:(E) Laboratory tests are more costly to perform than are physical examinations.Argument is not about cost effectiveness of a test. Out of scope.Answer must be Ahazelnut: Your issue from chatQuote:(A) Physical examinations and the uncovered laboratory tests together provide a more accurate diagnosis of many diseases than do physical examinations alone.I thought it is anecessary conditionfor doctor to perform the examinations.My explanation:re-read the argument. It is stating that doctors often employ lab tests to improve diagnosis. So in order to bridge the argument we need to state something that gives the idea that ""lab tests"" are indeed necessary for improving the diagnosis. Option ""A"" does just that. Modern physicians often employ laboratory tests, in addition to physical examinations, in order to diagnose diseases accurately. Insurance company regulations that deny coverage for certain laboratory tests therefore decrease the quality of medical care provided to patients.Which one of the following is an assumption that would serve to justify the conclusion above?Given: Lab Test + Physical Examination --> Accurate diagnose of diseases.Insurance Company Deny coverage of certain Lab Test --> decrease the quality of medical care provided to patients.Author assumes that Lab tests which would be denied by Insurance Co. play important role in accurate diagnose of diseases.(A) Physical examinations and the uncovered laboratory tests together provide a more accurate diagnosis of many diseases than do physical examinations alone.Yes.

After Applying variance test it strenthens and weakens the argument, then why is it not an answer??Remember the conclusion:If Insurance company denies cost for certain medical tests then there is decrease in the quality of medical care provided to patients (by insurance company).This option - option C - talks about case/possibility, where people dont have any health insurance. That means there is no question of impact on quality of healthcare provided by an insurance company (to that patient).

Powerscore official solutionThe conclusion in this stimulus is that insurance company regulations which deny coverage for lab tests decrease the quality of health care. This conclusion requires a couple assumptions. First, that the insurance restrictions are leading to reduced use of tests. (This seems like a plausible assumption according to ordinary economic reasoning, but it is not stated in the stimulus.) Second, that the lab tests actually improve the quality of health care.The question stem asks us to ""justify"" the conclusion, meaning that a single correct answer choice will fill in all the missing assumptions and make the argument air-tight.Answer choice (A): This is the correct answer choice. This answer choice states that the lab tests improve quality of medical care. This is the best answer choice, although it does not exactly ""justify"" the conclusion as the question stem asks. Note that the argument still has a missing assumption: it has failed to establish that the insurance restrictions are reducing use of the tests by patients. The LSAT test makers did not choose their words very carefully here.Answer choice (B): The personal opinion of physicians regarding the insurance restrictions does not give us a clear implication about whether these lab tests improve quality of care. Perhaps physicians favor these tests because they truly provide value for patients \96 or perhaps physicians favor these tests because they are good revenue generators.Answer choice (C): If some patients who might benefit from the tests have no health insurance whatsoever, then the insurance restrictions do not affect these patients. A reduction of quality of care is thus impossible for these patients (unless we make the roundabout argument that doctors lose revenue and thus the overall quality of their medical practice suffers). This answer choice tends to weaken the stimulus argument.Answer choice (D): Even if ""some"" illnesses can be diagnosed without lab tests, this answer choice does not speak to the issue of whether lab tests improve quality of medical care. If anything, this answer choice weakens the stimulus by showing that lab tests are not quite so valuable as we might suppose.Answer choice (E): This answer choice does not speak to the issues of (1) value added for patients by the lab tests, or (2) whether the insurance restrictions are reducing use of the lab tests.

We need an assumption along this line of reasoning.The reasoning in the passage assumes which one of the following?(A) A nation that does not lend to any other nation cannot be a world leader.- Out(B) A nation that can set the terms of its dealings with other nations is certain to be a world leader.- No. We're told the nation can be one, but not definitely one (which the word 'certain' suggests)(C) A nation that has the terms of its dealings with another action set by that nation cannot be a world leader.- Yes. If we're told a nation that has the terms of its dealing set by another nation and this is sufficient to make it not be a 'world leader', then it's true that a nation that does not owe money (sets the terms) is a world leader.(D) A nation that is a world leader can borrow from another nation as long as that other nation does not set the terms of the dealings between the two nations.- No. Does not tells us why not oweing money makes a nation a world leader(E) A nation that has no dealings with any other nation cannot be world leader.- OutI'll take C Re-posting for further discussion.Aristotle CR.Economic considerations colour every aspect of international dealings, and nations are just like individuals in that the lender sets the terms of its dealings with the borrower.

What exactly does C mean by another action set? A,E straight away out.I chose B initially which Says: (B) A nation that can set the terms of its dealings with other nationsis certainto be a world leader.But, I found the wording of the statement is really strong.This is less like an assumption but seems more like a conclusion.My answer:(C) A nation that has the terms of its dealings with another action set by thatnation cannot be a world leader.This perfectly fits as the answer and also matches the wording. Actually, B and C are equally strong. B says ""If X happens, then Y will certainly happen."" C says ""If X does NOT happen, Y will certainly NOT happen.""The easiest way to spot the difference is in looking at the end result. The argument concludes that certain countries will NOT be world leaders, so we need a choice that leads to that outcome. Knowing what will guarantee leadership does not tell us what willpreventleadership. However, we could just as well look at the first part of the conditional. We are talking about countries that CANNOT set their own terms, so the premise feeds into C, not B.A more intuitive way to look at it is that B helps us to conclude that lending countries ARE world leaders (something the argument isn't claiming), while C addresses the actual claim made in the argument: that borrowing countries cannot be world leaders._________________Dmitry Farber | Manhattan Prep GMAT Instructor | San DiegoManhattan GMAT Discount|Manhattan GMAT Course Reviews|View Instructor ProfileSignature Read More vprabhalaEconomic considerations color every aspect of international dealings, and nations are just like individuals in that the lender sets the terms of its dealings with the borrower.

Indeed, as far as we're concerned, maybe none of them can be a world leader.So we're concluding that a nation that owes money to another nation cannot be a world leader. But all we know from the premise about the debtor nation is that it doesn't get to set the terms of the deal -- it's the lender who gets to set the terms. So we need an assumption that says, ""If you're not setting the terms of your loan, you can't be a world leader.""That's exactly what (C) says, which is why it's correct.(A) is out because this doesn't tell us anything about the nation that owes money.(B) also is irrelevant as we discussed; we care about the nation that borrows, not the one that lends.(D) was tempting to me, but it's actually backwards. It's telling us that if the other nation doesn't set the terms, you can be a world leader -- but that doesn't mean you can't be a world leader if the other nation does set the terms.(E) is incorrect because we're talking about a nation that does have dealings with other nations.

Thus, the comparison of the argument is INVALID.(B) Historical accounts by monastic chroniclers in the years 1300 to 1400 are filled with descriptions of violent attacks committed by people living in the French realmWrong.Irrelevant. Just the description of violent attacks does not help anything.(C) The number of individual agreements between two people in which they swore oaths not to attack each other increased substantially after 1300.Wrong.Irrelevant. Nothing about the agreement between two people.(D) When English armies tried to conquer parts of France in the mid- to late 1300s. violence in the northern province of Normandy and the south-western province of Gascony increased.Wrong.Does not weaken the conclusion.

Now let's have a look at the two options where you were stuck:Quote:(A) In the years 1300 to 1400 the French government's category of violent crimes included an increasing variety of interpersonal crimes that are actually nonviolent.Let us prove this option with the help of an analogy. For example, in the year 2017, there were 3 types of accidents that were considered fatal: car crash, bike crash, and a bus crash. For the three types, the number of casualties was, let's say, 30. In the year 2018, the government extended the list to include 2 more types of accidents: trip over while walking on the road and slap someone on the face. Both the new ""accidents"" aren't fatal in nature. The number of accidents that took place in 2018 was 40 out of which 20 could be categorized under the newly added types. If you see, the number of fatal accidents actually reduced because the number of non-fatal accidents increased.Similarly, we can say that the increase in the number of violent cases was because of the non-violent cases, weakening the argument.I hope that helps!Regards Hiadkikani,Let's review the question, as well as (A) and (D).Court records from medieval France show that in the years 1300 to 1400 the number of people arrested in the French realm for ""violent interpersonal crimes"" (not committed in wars) increased by 30 percent over the number of people arrested for such crimes in the years 1200 to 1300.The increase was not the result of false arrests;therefore, medieval France had a higher level of documented interpersonal violence in the years 1300 to 1400 than in the years 1200 to 1300.Green = background/premiseLight blue = subconclusionDark blue = primary conclusionWhich one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) In the years 1300 to 1400 the French government's category of violent crimes included an increasing variety of interpersonal crimes that are actuallynonviolent. --So a category was added. Because of this, we know right off the bat that more crimes were tallied than prior, so this clearly weakens it.(D) When English armies tried to conquer parts of France in the mid- to late 1300s. violence in the northern province of Normandy and the south-western province of Gascony increased. --While this is interesting, note that the premise says ""not committed in war"". Due to this, any crimes committed would not be tallied and this increase wouldn't matter. Now you are correct that it never specifies where in France the battles took place; however, the premise doesn't clarify if you need to be in that part of the country to have it not count. Because of this, we have to assume it means all of France, regardless of geography (this isn't a geography class and the GMAT isn't testing your knowledge of the world, haha).

"Leachate is a solution, frequently highly contaminated, that develops when water permeates a landfill site. If and only if the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachate escape into the environment, generally in unpredictable quantities.

Most landfill leachate is send directly to sewage treatment plants, but not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The ability to predict the volume of escaping landfill leachate would help solve the disposal problem.(B) If any water permeates a landfill, leachate will escape into the environment.(C) No sewage treatment plants are capable of handling leachate.(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.ShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","I was stuck between D and E but I think E is stronger.(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.even though there are plants that are incapable of handling leachate (as it was mentioned in the last sentence), it would be presumptuous of us to assume that the leachate are actually sent to those plants.  Maybe leachates are only sent to sewage plants that can handle it.  We cannot say.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill's capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.as stated in the argument - ""if and only if"". Quote:Could anybody clarify why D is incorrect?Quote:E is a mere paraphrasing of the stimulus --- there is no inference per se here.Hi,an inference is an implied conclusion.  But on a GMAT inference question, if you see an answer choice that must be true based on the stimulus, you should always automaticlaly select it.  There are two reasons for this: a) what you think is a simple paraphrase may actually have something new in it, and can thus be regarded as a proper inference; and b) some questions simply ask you to treat the passage as true, and select a choice that ""must be true""--in these cases, the correct answer may even be a restatement of one of the statements in the passage.In a GMAT inference question, a choice that must be true based on one or more statements in the passage is ALWAYS automatically correct.Thus, the the four wrong answers are things that could be false.Let's apply this approach to this question.In the passage we learn that leachate gets into the environmentif and only if the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded.  This means two things.  First, whenever the landfill's capacity is exceeded, some leachate will definitely escape into the environment.  Second, if the landfill's capacity is NOT exceeded, then there is nothing to worry about.  (Formally, the landfill's capacity being exceeded is both a sufficient and necessary condition for leachate escaping into the environment).Let's consider choices D and E:(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.Well, I can see why this is tempting.  After all, the last sentence told us that leachate (well, most of it anyways) is sent to sewage treatment plants, and that some sewage treatment plants can't handle leachate. But did we learn whether any leachate goes to the plants that can't hanlde it? Nope.  Fine, there may be some plants that can't handle leachate, but it could easily be the case that no leachate is actually sent to these plants--that leachate is only sent to plants that CAN handle leachate.Thus, choice D could be false, and we can eliminate it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.Well, we learned that if the landfill's capacity were exceeded that leachate will for sure escape into the environment.  So, if no leachate escaped, then capacity was not exceeded (because if capacity were exceeded, leachate would have escaped!).  (Many of you will recognize this concept as the ""contrapositive"").Thus, choice E must be true (based on the passage).  Thus, choice E must be correct.TAKEWAY: in GMAT inference questions stay very CLOSE to the passage.  If you see a choice that must be true, it is undoubtedly the correct answer.  If you see a choice that could be false, it is undoubtedly an incorrect answer.SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS QUESTION: this is an LSAT or else an LSAT-like question.  It tests formal logic in a way that GMAT CR never would. asafLeachate is a solution, frequently highly contaminated, that develops when water permeates a landfill site. If and only if the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachate escape into the environment, generally in unpredictable quantities. A method must be found for disposing of leachate. Most landfill leachate is send directly to sewage treatment plants, but not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The ability to predict the volume of escaping landfill leachate would help solve the disposal problem.(B) If any water permeates a landfill, leachate will escape into the environment.(C) No sewage treatment plants are capable of handling leachate.(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONThe correct answer choice is (E). The key to this problem is the “if and only if” construction in the second sentence. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, when you encounter that construction, you must respond under the assumption that you will be tested on your knowledge of the relationship produced by that phrase. In this case, the following scenario is produced: CE = the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded, LE = leachate escape into the environment. CE<——>LE. According to our knowledge of the double-arrow relationship, only two possible scenarios can result: 1. CE and LE or 2. ~CE and ~LE. You should immediately glance at the question stem and determine what question you are being asked, and then attack the answer choices with the knowledge above. Answer choice (E) reflects scenario 2 above, and (E) is correct.Answer choice (A): Although leachate escapes in “generally unpredictable” quantities, there is no evidence in the stimulus to suggest that the ability to predict the volume of escaping leachate would help solve the problem. This is a good example of an answer that sounds reasonable or likely to be true, but is incorrect.Answer choice (B): No. Leachate escapes into the environment if the landfill’s capacity is exceeded, not just if any water permeates a landfill. If the water permeating the landfill caused the capacity to be exceeded then this answer would be correct, but the answer does not indicate that the capacity is exceeded.Answer choice (C): This is an Exaggerated answer. The stimulus indicates that “not all” sewage plants are capable of handling leachate. The answer choice exaggerates “not all” into none.Answer choice (D): This is a tricky reworking of the final sentence. The last sentence contains two separate statements, one indicating most landfill leachate is sent to sewage plants and the other revealing that not all sewage plants can handle leachate. But, that does not mean that any leachate is sent to those plants incapable of handling leachate. Thus, answer choice (D) is incorrect.Answer choice (E): This is the correct answer, and this is the answer you should have been seeking after identifying the “if and only if” in combination with the Must Be True question. Incidentally, when looking for a correct answer in this situation, scenario 2 from the top of the page is more likely to appear than scenario 1 for the simple reason that scenario 2 represents a manipulation of the original statement._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More EIF X then Y => If NOT Y then NOT X OA is E.Could anybody clarify why D is incorrect?Thanks, E is a mere paraphrasing of the stimulus --- there is no inference per se here. I dont agree with OA. Also D which I think is right does not imply all sewage plants are incapable of handling leachate as one poster has commented. D says that some leachate goes is sent to sewage treatment plants THAT are incapable of handling it --- using SC knowledge - THAT is a restrictive modifier - so it is talking about THOSE sewage plants that cannot handle leachate. In fact if D had been worded such as - some leachate is sent to sewage treatment plants, WHICH are incapable of handling it --- then it COULD have indicated a possibility that the sewage treatment plants are incapable of handling it. Excellent! I am impressed - completely!I missed the point that the leachates may after all NOT land up at any of the plants incapable of handling them! Gosh!The other thing that threw me off and which I now remember is having failed to answer a similar question - albeit as I now recollect - was an assumption question - in which one of the (incorrect) answer choices was a paraphrase from the passage - and which I immediately jumped at and selected; turned out it was wrong. That kinda stayed in my memory and now when I saw this question that alarm went off again - because choice E sounded very much like a paraphrase and I felt it was a trap. It is a no brainer practically to see that E is true but well oh well... my bad...TestluvQuote:Could anybody clarify why D is incorrect?Quote:E is a mere paraphrasing of the stimulus --- there is no inference per se here.Hi,an inference is an implied conclusion.  But on a GMAT inference question, if you see an answer choice that must be true based on the stimulus, you should always automaticlaly select it.  There are two reasons for this: a) what you think is a simple paraphrase may actually have something new in it, and can thus be regarded as a proper inference; and b) some questions simply ask you to treat the passage as true, and select a choice that ""must be true""--in these cases, the correct answer may even be a restatement of one of the statements in the passage.In a GMAT inference question, a choice that must be true based on one or more statements in the passage is ALWAYS automatically correct.Thus, the the four wrong answers are things that could be false.Let's apply this approach to this question.In the passage we learn that leachate gets into the environmentif and only if the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded.  This means two things.  First, whenever the landfill's capacity is exceeded, some leachate will definitely escape into the environment.  Second, if the landfill's capacity is NOT exceeded, then there is nothing to worry about.  (Formally, the landfill's capacity being exceeded is both a sufficient and necessary condition for leachate escaping into the environment).Let's consider choices D and E:(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.Well, I can see why this is tempting.  After all, the last sentence told us that leachate (well, most of it anyways) is sent to sewage treatment plants, and that some sewage treatment plants can't handle leachate. But did we learn whether any leachate goes to the plants that can't hanlde it? Nope.  Fine, there may be some plants that can't handle leachate, but it could easily be the case that no leachate is actually sent to these plants--that leachate is only sent to plants that CAN handle leachate.Thus, choice D could be false, and we can eliminate it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.Well, we learned that if the landfill's capacity were exceeded that leachate will for sure escape into the environment.  So, if no leachate escaped, then capacity was not exceeded (because if capacity were exceeded, leachate would have escaped!).  (Many of you will recognize this concept as the ""contrapositive"").Thus, choice E must be true (based on the passage).  Thus, choice E must be correct.TAKEWAY: in GMAT inference questions stay very CLOSE to the passage.  If you see a choice that must be true, it is undoubtedly the correct answer.  If you see a choice that could be false, it is undoubtedly an incorrect answer.SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS QUESTION: this is an LSAT or else an LSAT-like question.

That kinda stayed in my memory and now when I saw this question that alarm went off again - because choice E sounded very much like a paraphrase and I felt it was a trap.I'm glad you bring this up!As discussed in my post above, in an inference or must be true type of question, a choice that restates or paraphrases a part of the passage is automatically correct.However, in an assumption question, a choice that restates evidence is automatically wrong.  Why?  Because assumptions are, by definition, UNSTATED.So, we can say:In assumption questions, choices that restate evidence are automatically incorrect; in inference/must be true, choices that restate evidence are automatically correct. ANSWER IS SUPER EASY ERemembering the definition of inference will help to get the correct answer in under 10 seconds(i) Inference is a logical conclusion that can be drawn using one or more premises given in the argument.(ii)Also noteworthy is to remember that an inference must never be said or written explicitly in the argument (otherwise it will become just another premise)E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill's capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.We can infer this from the premise in the argument. ""If and only if the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachates escape into the environment""No leaking of leachate=Landfill still have capacity to hold leachate.CORRECT) Answer is EasafLeachate is a solutions, frequently highly contaminated, that develops when water permeates a landfill site, If and only if the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachates escape into the environment, generally in unpredictable quantities, A method must be found for disposing of leachate. Most landfill leachate is send directly to sewage treatment plants, but not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The ability to predict the volume of escaping landfill leachate would help solve the disposal problem.(B)If any water permeates a landfill, leachate will escape into the environment.(C) No sewage treatment plants are capable of handling leachate.(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill's capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.Can you deny D or E? Solutions 1:-For inference questions we must always be able to prove the answer choice by referring back to the argument. The answers are usually(1) Paraphrase of one or more of the premises in the argument(2) Logical conclusion from one or more premises in the argumentIf and only if the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachate escape into the environment,E is nothing but a paraphrase of whats given in the argument i.e using (1) abovebut not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated waterChoice D is Some landfill leachate is sent to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.Do we know that leachate has been sent to some sewage plants from whats given in the argument?? NO....If choice D wasSome sewage treatment plants are incapable of handling the leachate sent to them.-> YES this would be a logical conclusion i.e. using (2) above asafLeachate is a solutions, frequently highly contaminated, that develops when water permeates a landfill site, If and only if the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachates escape into the environment, generally in unpredictable quantities, A method must be found for disposing of leachate. Most landfill leachate is send directly to sewage treatment plants, but not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water.Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?(A) The ability to predict the volume of escaping landfill leachate would help solve the disposal problem.(B)If any water permeates a landfill, leachate will escape into the environment.(C) No sewage treatment plants are capable of handling leachate.(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill's capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.There are three claims in this stimulus.1. If, and only, if the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachate escape into the environment.2. Most landfill leachate is sent directly to sewage treatment plants.3. Not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water.We need to find an answer that we can infer from one or more of these statements.(A) may be true and seems to make sense, but is an unsupported prediction. It may not help solve the problem, however.(B) contradicts the stimulus. The first claim says that leachate will escape into the environment if, and only if, the landfill's capacity is exceeded - not if leachate permeates a landfill.(C) is not necessarily true. We know that not all sewage plants are capable of handling the highly contaminated water. That does not mean that no sewage plants are capable of handling leachate.(D) attempts to combine the second and third statement. However, no inference can be made from combining a SOME statement in the third claim and a MOST statement in the second claim. According to these two claims, it's possible that all leachate is sent directly to only those sewage treatment plants that are capable of handling the contaminated water.(E) must be true. This is part of what can be inferred from the contrapositive of the first statement. Answer E and below is the explanation for the same(A) The ability to predict the volume of escaping landfill leachate would help solve the disposal problem. -This won't necessarily solve the problem, if we don't develop a new method to fix the issue or even if we rely on sewage treatment plants, we would need to enable them to handle highly contaminated water,(B) If any water permeates a landfill, leachate will escape into the environment. -No, water will escape only if the landfill capacity to hold water is excedded(C) No sewage treatment plants are capable of handling leachate. -Argument says there are some which can handle(D) Some landfill leachate is send to sewage treatment plants that are incapable of handling it.Nothing mentioned for this account(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.This is the contrapositive of the condition mention in the argument, hence the answer Hold on...regarding E), what if the reason why the leachate HAS NOT escaped is that it was sent off to the plants? So maybe it in fact was exceeded...The passage tells us that IFF the landfill's capacity to hold liquids is exceeded does the leachate escape, but it doesn't preclude the possibility that people could have handled it... Premise: If and only if X [the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids is exceeded] Then Y [ leachate escapes into the environment]Above condition is bidirectional i.e. X is both necessary and sufficient for Y,  and Y is both necessary and sufficient for X.(E) If leachate does not escape from a landfill into the environment, then the landfill’s capacity to hold liquids has not been exceeded.

"If we are to expand the exploration of our solar system our next manned flight should be to Phobos, one of Mars's moons, rather than to Mars itself. The flight times to each are the same but the Phobos expedition would require less than half the fuel load of a Mars expedition and would, therefore, be much less costly. So, it is clear that Phobos should be our next step in space exploration.Which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain the difference in fuel requirement?(A) More equipment would be required to explore Phobos than to explore Mars.(B) Smaller spaceships require less fuel than larger spaceships.(C) Information learned during the trip to Phobos can be used during a subsequent trip to Mars.(D) The shortest distance between Phobos and Mars is less than half the shortest distance between Earth and Mars.(E) Lift-off for the return trip from Phobos requires much less fuel than that from Mars because of Phobos weaker gravitational pull.(Aristotle, Critical Reasoning Practice Set - I, Q. 35)ShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","According to the argument:Fuel load requirement for Phobos expedition = half of fuel load for Mars expedition->    Phobos expedition is less costly -> next manned flight should be to PhobosQuestion stem wants us to identify a statement, if true, would strengthen our belief that:Fuel load requirement for Phobos expedition = half of fuel load for Mars expeditionLets look at the options:(A) More equipment would be required to explore Phobos than to explore Mars.Talks about equipment requirement. Argument focuses on fuel requirement.(B) Smaller spaceships require less fuel than larger spaceships.Relates fuel requirement to size of spaceship. We do not know about the size of spaceship that is required for either of the two expeditions.(C) Information learned during the trip to Phobos can be used during a subsequent trip to Mars.Talks about usage of information gathered from one expedition for another expedition's purpose. Our focus is to explain the difference in the fuel requirement for the 2 expeditions.(D) The shortest distance between Phobos and Mars is less than half the shortest distance between Earth and Mars.Though distance can be related to fuel requirement, here the option talks about distance between (i) Phobos and Mars and (ii) Earth and Mars. We still cant infer the distance between Earth & Phobos and thus cant compare it with distance between Earth & Mars.(E) Lift-off for the return trip from Phobos requires much less fuel than that from Mars because of Phobos weaker gravitational pull.Correct answer.

It is as well possible that even after the analysis, some bridges collapse. hence statement D cannot be inferred.I am not sure what is you point about option E - you yourself concluded that ""thumb rule is unsafe"" - so you are actually supporting that option E is correct. why not B - if cooper was present, he could have stopped the construction... any one can enlighten me on the same... thanks in advance vishwashwhy not B - if cooper was present, he could have stopped the construction... any one can enlighten me on the same... thanks in advanceIf B is correct can you explain these lines of the passage.As a direct result of the inquiry that followed, the engineering ""rules of thumb"" by which thousands of bridges had been built around the world went down with the Quebec Bridge.The incident was more of a result of the use of ""rule of thumb"" rather absence of this guy. moreover what if he is present and could not have done those calculation.IMO E OFFICIAL ANSWER:The question requires the examinee to identify the response that can be properly inferred from the passage. The passage indicates that the Quebec Bridge disaster in 1907 and the inquiry that followed caused the engineering “rules of thumb” used in construction of thousands of bridges to be abandoned. Since the Quebec Bridge disaster in 1907 prompted this abandonment, it can be inferred that these were the rules of thumb under which the Quebec Bridge was being built when it collapsed and that these were the rules of thumb used in bridge building before 1907. Further, since the Quebec Bridge collapsed while under construction and the rules of thumb being used were abandoned as a result, it can be inferred that the rules of thumb used in building the Quebec Bridge and bridges prior to 1907 were insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction. Finally, since the alternative to the old engineering rules of thumb that was adopted was to “depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis,” it can be inferred that it was the mathematical analysis incorporated in the engineering rules of thumb used prior to 1907 that made them insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction. Thus, (E) is the credited response.Response (A) is incorrect. (A) asserts that the lack of thorough mathematical analysis in the construction of bridges before about 1907 was sufficient to establish that those bridges were unsafe for the public to use. But, the rules of thumb used in bridge construction before 1907 were abandoned because they were not sufficient to establish that the bridges being constructed using them were safe when under construction. It does not follow that the lack of more rigorous or thorough mathematical analysis in the rules of thumb was sufficient to establish that the bridges built before about 1907 using them were unsafe even while under construction, let alone for the public. In fact, some, or even all, may have been quite safe. In addition, the passage gives evidence only about the safety of bridges built before 1907 while they were under construction. It is silent on whether bridges built before about 1907 were safe when open for use by the public.Response (B) is incorrect in claiming that Cooper’s absence from the construction site caused the breaking off of the cantilever. The passage does not establish that, had Cooper been at the site, he could have successfully intervened to prevent the cantilever from breaking off. By freezing the project, he might have spared lives by stopping work, but there is nothing in the passage to indicate that he necessarily would have prevented the collapse.Response (C) is incorrect; there is no evidence in the passage about why nineteenth-century engineers relied on their rules of thumb.Response (D) is also incorrect. While the passage suggests that a more rigorous application of mathematical analysis would have prevented the collapse of the bridge, it offers no evidence that it is the only way the collapse could have been prevented. For example, it might have been prevented had corrective measures been taken in time.OPTION:E EchelonStrike2016During construction of the Quebec Bridge in 1907, the bridge’s designer, Theodore Cooper, received word that the suspended span being built out from the bridge’s cantilever was deflecting downward by a fraction of an inch. Before he could telegraph to freeze the project, the whole cantilever arm broke off and plunged, along with seven dozens workers, into the St. Lawrence River. It was the worst bridge construction disaster in history. As a direct result of the inquiry that followed, the engineering “rules of thumb” by which thousands of bridges had been built went down with the Quebec Bridge. Twentieth-century bridge engineers would thereafter depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis.Which one of the following statements can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) Bridges built before about 1907 were built without thorough mathematical analysis and, therefore, were unsafe for the public to use.(B) Cooper’s absence from the Quebec Bridge construction site resulted in the breaking off of the cantilever.(C) Nineteenth-century bridge engineers relied on their rules of thumb because analytical methods were inadequate to solve their design problems.(D) Only a more rigorous application of mathematical analysis to the design of the Quebec Bridge could have prevented its collapse.(E) Prior to 1907 the mathematical analysis incorporated in engineering rules of thumb was insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction.The question requires us to find a logical inference from the given statements, i.e., the passage.The passage provides the following information:-The context is the construction of the Quebec Bridge in 1907; the bridge’s designer, Theodore Cooper, received word that the suspended span being built out from the bridge’s cantilever was deflecting downward by a fraction of an inch.- Before he could telegraph to freeze the project, the whole cantilever arm broke off and plunged, along with seven dozens workers, into the St. Lawrence River.- It was the worst bridge construction disaster in history. As a direct result of the inquiry that followed, the engineering “rules of thumb” by which thousands of bridges had been built went down with the Quebec Bridge.-Twentieth-century bridge engineers would thereafter depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis.As can be seen from the above-mentioned information, the process of measurement on which bridge construction were based played an important role and after the disaster, were changed as it was felt that the previous process was inadequate.This option mentions bridges that are already built and have been in use for a considerable amount of time. This option does not deal with the process of construction during which the measurements play an important role. So, Option A can be eliminated.All the sentences in the passage mention measurements, so the indication is that a lack of proper measurements probably had something to do with the disaster. There is no information to indicate that Cooper’s absence created the problem or that his presence could have averted the disaster. So, Option B can be eliminated.The passage only states that there were engineering “rules of thumb” by which thousands of bridges had been built; there is no mention or indication of any other method of measurement. In fact, the passage states that twentieth-century bridge engineers would thereafter depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis. So, Option C can be eliminated.This option has the adverb ‘only’, which is to be treated with caution. The passage describes an incident and mentions a result of that incident. There is no information to indicate what might have prevented the incident. The passage does state that twentieth-century bridge engineers would thereafter depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis, but that is not enough information to suggest that nothing else would have prevented the disaster. So, Option D can be eliminated.Option E states that the mathematical analysis incorporated in engineering rules of thumb prior to 1907 was insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction. This option sums up the idea that the disaster was probably caused by a gap in the process of measurement.Therefore E is the most appropriate option.Jayanthi Kumar._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

The key here is to look at what would happen if the opposite of (A) was true - would the argument still stand? The argument itself is that the word explosion gets more of a reaction than ""energetic disassembly,"" and that the increased reaction is a good thing.If (A) were to be negated, it would read something along the lines of ""the advantages of the desirable reactions do NOT outweigh the disadvantages of the undesirable reactions.""

Can you please explain?What is ABC test?Conclusion:Quote:the government's violation of the right of private businesses to determine their own policies and rule.means government violated  their right of business and hence was not justified. It is the same means as what you have stated.We need to find an option that completes the conclusion of government  violating the rights.OptionC:  Right of business is above the government right to protect the individual. With this , conclusion is reasonable. I am surprised that option D has got so much less voting though it too seems to be a strong contender :(D) It is the duty of private businesses to protect employees from harm in the workplace.The conclusion is that it is not the point whether non-smoker will be harmed. Rather, government should not step into the territory of private business and infringe its right to create rules.The option D supports this conclusion that it is the responsibility of the private business to protect its employees. How it will achieve the same should be left to the business itself.

Question stem is asking which one of the choices basically fills the gap/jump to reach that conclusion.First of all, the argument is about govt legislation and eventually govt breaking that.(A) Government intrusion into the policies and rules of private businesses is justifiedonly when individuals might be harmed. - WRONG. Harm aspect is not the core of the argument.(B) The right of individuals to breathe safe airsupersedesthe right of businesses to be free from government intrusion. - WRONG. True may be but not impacting conclusion.(C) The right of businesses to self-determinationoverrideswhatever right or duty the government may have to protect the individual. - CORRECT. Only if one's right is superior to other's than the conclusion can be reached.(D) It is thedutyof private businesses to protect employees from harm in the workplace. - WRONG. This looks great but it is out of scope since duty is different than legislation. Finally, even if it is so then conclusion is not necessarily reached out.(E) Where the rights of businesses and the duty of government conflict, the main issue is finding a successfulcompromise. - WRONG.

But this is the correct one. Because the children clearly distinguished one RP from another.For every child, there was only one RP in the  group of RP's and utensils.

Which one of the following inferences is most supported by the information above?a) The children did not grasp the function of a rolling pin.Most probably they did becuase they used the rolling pins in action. But over here the experiment tests something entirely different. It does not test the understanding of the function of the rolling pin by children but it tests whether children can identify a rolling pin.b) No two children understood the name “rolling pin” to apply to the same object.Exactly, the children did not pick up other rolling pins but only the ones that they used for the pie dough. This shows that *all* of the children understood the name ""rolling pin"" to apply to one object, the object that they used.c) The children understood that all rolling pins have the same general shape.No. On the contrary, the children understood that a rolling pin can only be 1.d) Each child was able to identify correctly only the utensils that he had used.We do not know anything about what the children did with the other utensils during the experiment when children were asked to identify what they had used. We are only given information about rolling pins.

No two children picked the same rolling pin and therefore no two children understood the name “rolling pin” toapply to the same object.(C) The children understood that all rolling pins have the same general shape - Incorrect - If this was true , then children would have chosen other rolling pins too(D) Each child was able to identify correctly only the utensils that he had used - ISWAT - a rolling pin is a utensil, but there are other utensils as well, and the stimulus does not give us information about whether the children could identify those utensils.(E) The children were not able to distinguish the rolling pins they used from other rolling pins - Incorrect - 180 answerAnswer B Which one of the following inferences is most supported by the information above?(A) The children did not grasp the function of rolling pinTotally reverse...Infact they were able to grasp the function(B) No two children understood the name ""rolling pin"" to apply to the same objectBecause the children clearly distinguished one Rolling Pin from another.For every child, there was only one RP in the group of RP's and utensils.

So what can we infer from this? Since each boy only identified the rolling pin he and his father had used, and since all the rolling pins are different, we can infer (B): that no two boys associated the name “rolling pin” with the same object.(A) There’s a subtle scope shift happening here; the children are asked to identify the pins, not explain how they’re used. The mere fact that they couldn’t extend the definition of rolling pin to other pins doesn’t mean they didn’t understand the function of the pin they did identify.(C), if anything, runs counter to the stimulus, since the children did not seem to understand that the term “rolling pin” can refer to a category of objects. If (C) were true, chances are the boys would have been able to identify the other rolling pins in the room.(D) Mind the scope! The conclusion deals only with rolling pins, so we have no right to extend this conclusion to include all the utensils used in the experiment.(E) contradicts the stimulus. The children certainly could distinguish their own rolling pins from the others; otherwise, how could each child pick out from the rest of the rolling pins only the one he and his father had used?• (D) is the odd man out here; all the other choices stick to rolling pins, while (D) gets wild and speaks of utensils in general. That earns a quick rejection.• In inference questions, keep an eye out for au-contraire choices like choice (C) and choice (E)—choices that, far from inferable, actually run counter to the information in the stimulus._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More In an experiment, two-year-old boys and their fathers made pie dough together using rolling pins and other utensils.

Each father-son pair used a rolling pin that was distinctively different from those used by the other father-son pairs, and each father repeated the phrase ""rolling pin"" each time his son used it. But when the children were asked to identify all of the rolling pins among a group of kitchen utensils that included several rolling pins, each child picked only the one that he had used.Which one of the following inferences is most supported by the information above?(A) The children did not grasp the function of rolling pin(B) No two children understood the name ""rolling pin"" to apply to the same object(C) The children understood that all rolling pins have the same general shape(D) Each child was able to identify correctly only the utensils that he had used(E) The children were not able to distinguish the rolling pins they used from other rolling pinsOFFICIAL EXPLANATION:The upshot of this interesting experiment is that each child associated the term “rolling pin” with only the exact object he had previously encountered, not with a category of objects that all serve the same purpose. So what can we infer from this? Since each boy only identified the rolling pin he and his father had used, and since all the rolling pins are different, we can infer (B): that no two boys associated the name “rolling pin” with the same object.(A) There’s a subtle scope shift happening here; the children are asked to identify the pins, not explain how they’re used. The mere fact that they couldn’t extend the definition of rolling pin to other pins doesn’t mean they didn’t understand the function of the pin they did identify.(C), if anything, runs counter to the stimulus, since the children did not seem to understand that the term “rolling pin” can refer to a category of objects. If (C) were true, chances are the boys would have been able to identify the other rolling pins in the room.(D) Mind the scope! The conclusion deals only with rolling pins, so we have no right to extend this conclusion to include all the utensils used in the experiment.(E) contradicts the stimulus. The children certainly could distinguish their own rolling pins from the others; otherwise, how could each child pick out from the rest of the rolling pins only the one he and his father had used?• (D) is the odd man out here; all the other choices stick to rolling pins, while (D) gets wild and speaks of utensils in general. That earns a quick rejection.• In inference questions, keep an eye out for au-contraire choices like choice (C) and choice (E)—choices that, far from inferable, actually run counter to the information in the stimulus.I have a query with the answer choice A. If the children would have understood the functionality of the pins they would have no problem identifying any kind of rolling pin irrespective of the shape/size?GMATNinjaegmatrequest your inputs!

Each father-son pair used a rolling pin that was distinctively different from those used by the other father-son pairs, and each father repeated the phrase ""rolling pin"" each time his son used it. But when the children were asked to identify all of the rolling pins among a group of kitchen utensils that included several rolling pins, each child picked only the one that he had used.Type - inference(A) The children did not grasp the function of rolling pin - From the text, it seems possible that the children did understand the function of a rolling pin; certainly, they were able to identify the rolling pin they used.(B) No two children understood the name ""rolling pin"" to apply to the same object - Correct - The answer must be true because we know that despite being asked to identify all the rolling pins, each child selected only the rolling pin he had used. No two children picked the same rolling pin and therefore no two children understood the name “rolling pin” toapply to the same object.(C) The children understood that all rolling pins have the same general shape - Incorrect - If this was true , then children would have chosen other rolling pins too(D) Each child was able to identify correctly only the utensils that he had used - ISWAT - a rolling pin is a utensil, but there are other utensils as well, and the stimulus does not give us information about whether the children could identify those utensils.(E) The children were not able to distinguish the rolling pins they used from other rolling pins - Incorrect - 180 answerAnswer BHiSkywalker18,I have read many of your explanations on the forum. Let me first thank you for helping all of us.From you explanation of option C, I understand that option C is contrary to what is stated in the passage. What I understand is that all children had a belief that rolling pins can be of only 1 type and shape that is they used while cooking. Children had no idea that there could be any other item with different shape that can be called as rolling pin. All in all, each child in isolation had different perspective about the rolling pin but each child understood that there is only one general shape (i.e. the shape of the rolling pin that child used) of rolling pin. Accordingly, we can say that children (individually) understood that all rolling pins have the same general shape.In view of above, why can't option C be correct.Thank you. DearVeritasKarishmaMartyTargetTestPrepGMATGuruNYAnthonyRitzIanStewart,Although I know why choice B. is right, I'm not clear why choice A. is wrong?If the children did in fact grasp the FUNCTION of rolling pin, then when asked to identify ALL rolling pins (according to the passage), they should be able to identify ALL of them, right?The fact the each child picked only the one he/she used indicates that the child did not understand what rolling pin actually is and/or how it functions.Why is this thinking wrong? varotkornDearGMATGuruNYVeritasKarishmaAnthonyRitzIanStewart,Although I know why choice B. is right, I'm not clear why choice A. is wrong?If the children did in fact grasp the FUNCTION of rolling pin, then when asked to identify ALL rolling pins (according to the passage), they should be able to identify ALL of them, right?The fact the each child picked only the one he/she used indicates that the child did not understand what rolling pin actually is and/or how it functions.Why is this thinking wrong?There is no necessary relationship between knowing an object's function and being able to identify that object. I know what the function of a time machine is, for example, but I wouldn't be able to recognize one. And I've seen designer chairs I had no idea were chairs at first, but I know what a chair is for. So answer A is not an inference from the passage. It is worded bizarrely, though; there seems to be an indefinite article missing._________________now teaching gmat focusianstewartgmat.comSignature Read More MBAhereIcomeD is incorrect because the passage never indicated that the children could identify only the utensils that they used. rolling pins, yes; utensils, no. a rolling pin is a utensil, but there are other utensils as well, and the stimulus does not give us information about whether the children could identify those utensils.EXACTLY; a very good point of differentiation that eliminates option D.

Papers that result from international collaboration are cited an average of seven times, whereas papers with single authors are cited only three times on average. This difference shows that research projects conducted by international research teams are of greater importance than those conducted by single researchers.Conclusion :- The argument links citation to importance. The argument concludes that since papers that result from international collaboration are on an average cited more than papers with single authors, research projects conducted by international research teams are of greater importance than those conducted by single researchers.We have to make an assumption based on above conclusion.The author is assuming that citation is linked to importance. Based on this we move on to answer choices.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?(A) Prolific writers can inflate the number of citations they receive by citing themselves in subsequent papers.Even if citation increases, we are not told about its link with importance. Wrong(B) It is possible to ascertain whether or not a paper is the product of international collaboration by determining the number of citations it has receivedEven if we are able to ascertain, we are not told about its link with importance.

Wrong. Hi, I eliminated option D i.e.(D) The collaborative efforts of scientists who are citizens of the same country do not produce papers that are as important as papers that are produced by international collaboration.Only because it does not talk about citation. Am I correct? Is there any other line of reasoning for its elimination? Scientific research that involves international collaboration has produced papers of greater influence, as measured by the number of times a paper is cited in subsequent papers, than has research without any collaboration. Papers that result from international collaboration are cited an average of seven times, whereas papers with single authors are cited only three times on average.

(Greater influence is calculated basis the no. of times a paper is cited)Facts: Intl. collaboration: Cited 7 times (avg). Not intl. collaboration: 3 times (avg)Conclusion: This gap hence proves that research projects conducted by intl. teams are of greater importance.An assumption is an unstated fact that acts as a bridge between premise and conclusion.Author says gap of 4 citations on avg means the papers which have more are of greater importance.Let's look at the answer options:(A) Prolific writers can inflate the number of citations they receive by citing themselves in subsequent papers.New information(B) It is possible to ascertain whether or not a paper is the product of international collaboration by determining the number of citations it has receivedThe author's conclusion is: Author says gap of 4 citations on avg means the papers which have more are of greater importance.The answer mentioned above is not the assumption to reach conclusion. It is an inference the author wants us try racking our head around, but is a trap. We have to find a link between premise and conclusion. This is what happens after conclusion.(C) The number of citations a paper receives is a measure of the importance of the research it reports.Looks nice, talks about both, let's keep it for now.(D) The collaborative efforts of scientists who are citizens of the same country do not produce papers that are as important as papers that are produced by international collaboration.We do not know about importance of papers. That is not what the question has asked(E) International research teams tend to be more generously funded than are single researchers.Funding, again not the assumption to prove the conclusion.Considering this, the answer should be C. Answer C is closer to me. I have written many research papers and have always appreciated the importance of citing sources. That is why I am more inclined to this answer, although I do not approve. I remember how, with the help ofhttps://ca.edubirdie.com/coursework-writing-servicesI was able to quickly and on time submit a project, where I used many quotes from other sources.

The answer choice does not imply that it is true for some and not for others. So, if military leaders have the same characteristic that the argument says represents the reason why business executives do not run and yet military leaders do, that would like providing the cause without the effect, undermining the argument's causal relationship - that not being comfortable with compromises and power-sharing causes business executives not to seek the position of president.Notice that answer choice (B) is also the strongest of all the answer choices. Generally is more like ""most."" Whereas each of the other answer choices represent ""some"" statements.Let's take a look at the incorrect answers:(A) doesn't address the cause and effect relationship directly. Had the argument said that only business executives played a role in the fundraising and back-room strategies this would have been a stronger answer choice.(C) is irrelevant. The argument does not preclude skill sets that fail to completely overlap.(D) would weaken the claim that politicians don't go into business, but does not weaken that business executives do not go into politics. Additionally, this answer choice doesn't suggest any reasons for why, which is at the heart of the argument.(E) is irrelevant. We are concerned with who runs for political office and why - not who is engaged in the fundraising.Does that make sense? If you think of this one as a positing a cause and effect relationship, you can approach from the standard approach for weakening:1. provide an example of an alternative cause2. provide an example of the presumed cause without the presumed effect3. provide an example of the presumed effect without the presumed causeAnswer choice (B) gives us the 2nd option. IMO: BIf true, then the premise of the conclusion fails,I see it as Person A making a excuse not to do something because of a lame excuse, when Person B does it despite that exact reason. Basically no more for excuses. MentorTutoringVeritasKarishmaAre we doubting on validity of premise in this official q?

Is the assessment of traits that is making this OA correct? I need to break the link between a premise and conclusion (here doubt the explanation that business execs do not run for politics) rather than saying the premise is false.E.g. A scores better in GMAT since his reasoning abilities are better than B.

Is the assessment of traits that is making this OA correct? I need to break the link between a premise and conclusion (here doubt the explanation that business execs do not run for politics) rather than saying the premise is false.E.g. A scores better in GMAT since his reasoning abilities are better than B. So we are gauging A and B on basis on measure of reasoning abilities though both have it.Hello,adkikani. I feel as if your reasoning is overwrought. Theconclusionis that, becausebusiness is largely hierarchical, whereas politics is coordinative—a premise—business executives tend to be uncomfortable with compromises and power sharing, which are inherent in politics. You are aiming to weaken this conclusion/explanation, not a given premise. If, as (B) states, military leaders, one of the three groups of people who have comprisedthe great majority of those who have sought to become president, are just as uncomfortable with compromises and power sharing as are business executives, then the explanation breaks down. This group of people would no longer fit the presidential profile the argument establishes.

How can we know which exhibits future scientists will find useful? Time travel hasn’t been developed yet...Let’s go to the answer choices.(A) has a bunch of term shifts. ""Irreplaceable"" is much stronger than ""most valuable,"" and ""overriding economic considerations"" is much stronger than ""raising funds."" Already, this answer choice is too extreme.But let’s say we take out those term shifts. Then this answer choice would basically say ""valuable exhibits should be preserved!"" This essentially restates the original conclusion. Any answer choice that tells us something we already know is wrong. Remember, assumptions are ALWAYS unstated.(B) isn’t assumed. The stimulus talks about museum exhibits naturally decaying, not being actively destroyed. More importantly, the stimulus never describes how to determine the scientific value of museum exhibits. Perhaps scientific value can be assessed by scientific analyses, or perhaps by psychic readings. We don’t know if scientific analyses will be used, so we don’t need to know whether or not such analyses would harm exhibits.(D) beautifully matches the assumption above. HOW on earth can we determine what will be valuable to future scientists??? The argument never lets us know, and (D) points this out.

Lets keep this as a weak contender for now.Eliminated after review of E.(E) At meals that included alcohol, relatively more of the total calories consumed came from carbohydrates and relatively fewer of them came from fats and proteins.Absolutely irrelevant to the conclusion.

What If they don't eat more, but the foods themselves contain higher amount of calories than usual?Let's take a look at the reasoning and the choice again:Reasoning:  It was found that at meals with which they drank alcoholic beverages, they consumed about 175 calories more from nonalcoholic source than they did at meals with which they did not drink alcoholic beverages.— So, the reasoning guarantees that one will eat about 175 calories If he or she drink alcoholic beverages. We can not question this since it is the fact.Choice: (D) The meals that were most carefully prepared and most attractively served tended to be those at which alcoholic beverages were consumed.—The point is that this contributes to the explanation— this answer itself is not the explanation — that said ""consumed about 175 calories more"".

IrrelevantE - Irrelevant.B is the answer IMO let us take a look at the main conclusion --schizophrenia is caused by damage to the physical structure of the brain.this is a cause and effect statement. We can write this as --damage to the physical structure of the brain --> schizophreniaOne of the simplest ways to approach an assumption question would be to figure out a flaw in the argument. Negating that flaw would lead us to an assumption made in the argument.Commonly found patterns of flaws in causal statements are reverse causation (Effect --> Cause) and alternate cause (Another cause --> effect).let us take a look at the answer options --Option A - IncorrectNot a proper comparison. We are comparing the brains of IDENTICAL TWINS -- from this we are deriving our conclusion that physical damage to the brain causes schizophrenia.Option B - IncorrectIf the smallness of the brain in the identical schizophrenic twin is due to ""medications"", this destroys the argument by providing an alternate cause.If it is due to schizophrenia itself, this tells us that the effect led to the cause (Reverse causation) -- again weakens the argument.By denying both these flaws, option B states an assumption.Option C - IncorrectNot a proper comparison. We are comparing the brains of IDENTICAL TWINS -- this helps us to control for other factors that might impact the brain size. We are not comparing the brain sizes of twins to those of other people.Option D - Incorrectthis directly contradicts the conclusion -- which says that different size (smaller brain size due to physical damage) is something that causes schizophreniaOption E - IncorrectNot relevant to the argument. the argument is concerned with WHAT CAUSES schizophrenia, not HOW LIKELY it is to occur._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More souvik101990The brains of identical twins are genetically identical.

Can someone explain why is it wrong .Argument:Mayor: Use tax revenue to bring a major highway to increase business.Citizens: You have other interests. Otherwise you would have made the business park which brings in much more business.It is an assumption question. How do we figure out the assumption? We look for the  option which is NECESSARY for the conclusion to hold. The conclusion of the argument of the citizens' group is this: You must have interests other than our economy in mind.We need to find the option that is necessary for the citizens to arrive at this conclusion. To charge the mayor with ""other interests"", the citizens must assume that the mayor knows that/agrees that the business park will get more business than the highway.Let's try to negate (B)Let's look at the other four options first.(B) The mayor does not accept that a new business park would bring in more new business than would the new highway.If this is true, can the citizens still say that he must have other interests? No, if he thinks that the highway would bring in same or more business, the citizens cannot say that he must have other interests. He is, apparently, working toward improving the economy only.Hence, (B) is an assumption of the argument.Now look at the other options:(A) Plainsville presently has no major highways running through it.This strengthens the mayor's perspective, not the citizens'. It is not as assumption made by the citizens.(C) The new highway would have no benefits for Plainsville other than attracting new business.The citizens are not assuming this. Whether the new highway or the business park would have other benefits, is irrelevant. They say that if attracting business was your aim, then you would made the business park.  The crux of the argument is which of the two have more economic benefit and hence which should have been chosen for the sake of improving economy.(D) The mayor is required to get approval for all tax revenue allocation plans from the city council.Irrelevant(E) Plainsville’s economy will not be helped unless a new business park of the sort envisioned by the citizens’ group is built.Again, not an assumption made by citizens.

If the Major thinks that a new highway would be more beneficial than a business park, then it is not likely that he has some other intentions - he genuinely intends to bring economic benefit for the town. Though he may be wrong in his decision, his intention cannot be questioned.On the other hand, if the mayor knows that a business park will be more beneficial, yet he is investing in highway rather than a business park, then his intentions can be questioned.Since the citizens question Mayor's intentions, they must have assumed that the Mayor thinks that business park is more beneficial, but still he is planning to invest in highway. souvik101990Mayor of Plainsville:In order to help the economy of Plainsville, I am using some of our tax revenues to help bring a major highway through the town and thereby attract new business to Plainsville.Citizens' group:You must have interests other than our economy in mind.

It doesn't matter whether there are currently no major highways or some. It could still be true that building the new major highway would attract new business.(B) This is a weird answer, but the CG does need to believe that the mayor is aware of and in agreement that a new business park would attract more business than the new highway.Here's a quick analogy:Paul: I'm gonna ask Betty to the prom.Dave: Well, you must be picking your prom date for reasons beyond attractiveness, because Veronica is more attractive than Betty.Dave is assuming a couple things:1. Paul is aware that Veronica exists (if he isn't, he could very well be picking Betty based purely on attractiveness; Betty just happens to be the most attractive girl he knows)2. Paul would agree that Veronica is more attractive than Betty (if he doesn't, then he could still be picking Betty based purely on attractiveness).Now, obviously, attractiveness sounds more subjective than ""which proposed course of action would bring in more business"". But those are still speculative ideas, not facts. So both of these assumptions still apply to the Mayor.Has the Mayor ever heard of this new business park idea? If not, then she might be picking the highway based on it being the most economically beneficial proposal she's aware of.Does the Mayor accept that the new business park would bring in more business? If she doesn't, then she might be picking the highway because she believes it to be the most economically beneficial proposal.(C) Why does the Citizens' Group have to assume that the ONLY benefit of the new highway to Plainsville is attracting new business?They don't. I agree that if there are other economic benefits besides attracting new businesses, that would indeed weaken the Citizens' Group's argument. BUT, the negation of (C) is not ""the new highway would have some ECONOMIC benefits other than attracting new business"". The negation of (C) is just ""the new highway would have SOME benefit other than attracting new business."" That statement is not precise enough to hurt the Citizens' Group's argument.(D) is out of scope; whether the mayor is ""required to get approval"" is irrelevant to the CG's argument.(E) This is again extreme (""unless""). The CG acknowledges that the economy would be helped by the new highway, just half as much as the new business park would help. Mayor of Plainville: In order to help the economy of Plainsville, I am using some of our tax revenues to help bring a major highway through the town and thereby attract new business to Plainsville.Citizens' group: You must have interests o&er than our economy in mind. If you were really interested in helping our economy, you would instead advocate the revenues to building a new business park, since it would bring in twice the business that your highway would.The argument by the citizens' group relies on which one of the following assumptions?(A) Plainsville presently has no major highways running through it. -The conclusion is that mayor is interested in things other than in improvement of economy. Number of major highways has no bearing on the conclusion.(B) The mayor accepts that a new business park would bring in more new business than would the new highway. -Correct. This proves that even though mayor knows that business parks are a better solution, still he is willing to build a highway.(C) The new highway would have no benefits for Plainsville other than attracting new business. -Too strong statement. Also it has no impact on the argument. If only it weakens the stand of citizens.(D) The mayor is required to get approval for all tax revenue allocation plans from the city council. -Out of scope(E) Plainsville economy will not be helped unless a new business park of the sort envisioned by the citizens' group is built. -This is again too strong statement. The argument being made by the citizens’ group is that the mayor must have ulterior motives in building a highway, since building a business park would be better for his stated goal behind building the highway (attracting business). This is an assumption question, we need to see which of these assumptions is required for the argument to hold up.D is obviously irrelevant and can be discarded. A is not an assumption at all, it is a stated fact. Same can be said for E. C is irrelevant whether or not the highway would have any benefits other than attracting new businesses is irrelevant. The conclusion is concerned with the mayor’s motives and the amount of business that the business park will bring to Plainville, compared to the amount that the highway will bring. PoE tells us that B is the right answer but we can also take a closer look at it. This assumption is necessary because if the Mayor does not accept that the business park will bring more business to Plainville, than the highway will, it means that the mayor has no other interests in mind. The mayor legitimately just thinks that the highway is what is best for Plainville’s economy. Understanding the argument - ­Mayor of Plainville: In order to help the economy of Plainsville, I am using some of our tax revenues to help bring a major highway through the town and thereby attract new business to Plainsville. - Plan/Goal.Citizens' group: You must have interests other than our economy in mind. - ConclusionIf you were really interested in helping our economy, you would instead advocate the revenues to building a new business park, since it would bring in twice the business that your highway would. - Supporting premise.The argument by the citizens' group relies on which one of the following assumptions?We need to find a missing premise or necessary/minimum condition.(A) Plainsville presently has no major highways running through it. - weakener.(B) The mayor accepts that a new business park would bring in more new business than would the new highway. - ok. He is willingly choosing the highway over the business park.(C) The new highway would have no benefits for Plainsville other than attracting new business. - Out of scope.(D) The mayor is required to get approval for all tax revenue allocation plans from the city council. - out of scope.(E) Plainsville economy will not be helped unless a new business park of the sort envisioned by the citizens' group is built. - No such minimum condition is established that only if this happens that happens. At best, it can be a strengthener for the supporting premise, but in a sense, the Citizen's group already coveys that.

The conclusion is that skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europe are in high demand in their home countries, so we must attack that conclusions.A) strengthens, not weakens.B) is the correct answer. If there aren't many jobs, then there is less demand, so therefore the workers may not be in high demand.C) Not relevantD) I considered this for a second, but just because they need to train new workers, that does not weaken the fact that skilled workers are in high demand. if anything, skilled workers would still be in demand which is why they are training unskilled workers.E) strengthens, not weakens. vaivish1723Recently, highly skilled workers in Eastern Europe have left jobs in record numbers to emigrate to the West.

Okay, first we need to understand the question is about skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europe.Premise -> Highly skilled workers left for whatever reasons(perhaps greener pastures) to other countries/West.Conclusion -> People who remain will get better jobs/will be in high demand.What can stop that from happening? Look for options that weaken the conclusion.Let's look at the options -A) Eastern European factories prefer to hire workers from their home countries rather than to import workers from abroad.Strengthens it. It says Eastern European factories (old employment factories of highly skilled workers,maybe!) prefer to hire workers from their home countries rather than to import workers from abroad. That means skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europe will get preference in getting job.(B) Major changes in Eastern European economic structures have led to the elimination of many positions previously held by the highly skilled emigrants.This can ding the bright prospects. When we reached to the conclusion that People who remain in Eastern Europe will get better jobs/will be in high demand. We have made this Assumption --> all those jobs, in which highly skilled workers were employed in are still there or there are job vacancies. Wrong assumption as most of those jobs are gone..oops!Weakens the conclusion and hence the right answer!(C) Many Eastern European emigrants need to acquire new skills after finding work in the West. - Irrelevant. We are not concerned about folks who left.(D) Eastern European countries plan to train many new workers to replace the highly skilled workers who have emigrated. - Sister of (A) Strengthens it.(E) Because of the departure of skilled workers from Eastern European countries, many positions are now unfilled. -  Strengthens the conclusion. Premise: -Recently, highly skilled workers in Eastern Europe have left jobs in record numbers to emigrate to the West.Conclusion:-It is therefore likely that skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europe are in high demand in their home countries.We are asked to weaken the argument , i.e, the conclusion. When we are asked to weaken the conclusion the answer choice must undermine the assumption that lead to the conclusion or provide an alternative means of achieving that conclusion or invalidate the conclusion with a logical reason.(A) Eastern European factories prefer to hire workers from their home countries rather than to import workers from abroad.- This wil strengthen the argument hence false.(B) Major changes in Eastern European economic structures have led to the elimination of many positions previously held by the highly skilled emigrants- This is the right answer as if this statement is true, it will invalidate or undermine the conclusion as if many positions will be eliminated there need not necessarily be a high demand for the remaining workers.(C) Many Eastern European emigrants need to acquire new skills after finding work in the West- This is out of scope on what already immigrated employees need to do.(D) Eastern European countries plan to train many new workers to replace the highly skilled workers who have emigrated- This broadens the scope of the argument and in a way strengthens the argument hence eliminate this.(E) Because of the departure of skilled workers from Eastern European countries, many positions are now unfilled.- this will strengthen the argument hence eliminate..Correct choice, as explained above , is B Confused between B and D. Could someone clarify?? LarryMConfused between B and D. Could someone clarify??Quote:(D) Eastern European countries plan to train many new workers to replace the highly skilled workers who have emigrated.Choice (D) is tempting because it suggests that skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europemightnot be in such high demand once the new workers are trained. But remember that we are trying to weaken the argument that the skilled workers ARE (presently) in high demand. If anything, choice (D) is evidence that there is a high demand for skilled workers, and that is why the countries plan to train new workers to fill that demand.Quote:(B) Major changes in Eastern European economic structures have led to the elimination of many positions previously held by the highly skilled emigrants.Choice (B), on the other hand, suggests that there is no need to fill the jobs that were vacated when the highly skilled workers in Eastern Europe emigrated to the West. This suggests that there would NOT be a high demand for the skilled workers who remained in their home countries in Eastern Europe. Thus, choice (B) weakens the argument and is the correct answer._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More arvind910619vaivish1723Recently, highly skilled workers in Eastern Europe have left jobs in record numbers to emigrate to the West.

Maybe these highly skilled workers flooded the job market and over saturated it and, thus, when they left, more workers wouldn't really be in demand.(2) It also assumes that these workers are going to be replaced. Maybe the companies realized that they are better off without these workers and so they are just going to eliminate those jobs of the people that left.(3) It makes a small assumption about where these skilled workers are from. While the argument is saying that these workers will be in demand if they ""remain"" in Eastern Europe, it never mentions another about their ""home countries."" Thus, since the argument is concluding that these workers will be in high demand in their home countries, there could also be a correct answer saying something like, ""Most of the skilled workers living in Eastern Europe now are from the United States, where which the job market is flooded with skilled workers.""(A) I think this is a tricky one. I thought it looked really good initially. However, ""preferring"" to hire workers from their home countries rather than importing workers actually seems to strengthen the argument a tiny bit. Sure, ""preference"" is not really indicative that there is ""high demand"" but it helps a tad. Either way, this answer choice absolutely does not weaken. We want an answer choice that says that these workers really still aren't in high demand.(B) gives us this. This is very similar to what I predicted in (2). If workers are leaving but their jobs are going to be eliminated anyway, we start to have a little bit of doubt that there will be a ""high demand"" for new workers. Why would there be? Many positions are going to get eliminated! If there WAS a ""high demand,"" there would be no need to eliminate these positions!(C) We don't care about those expatriates that ditched their Eastern European homeland! We only care about those people that stayed!(D) This actually strengthens a tiny bit because it shows a willingness for the Eastern Europeans to get back some skilled workers. If they plan to train them then we can assume that they need some more workers. If they need some more workers then I could safely say that there is some demand for workers!(E) Also strengthens as tiny bit. These jobs are unfilled! Let's fill them! GMATNinjaCould you please help me understand the argument? bv8562GMATNinjaCould you please help me understand the argument?The author concludes that it is likely that skilled workers who remain in Eastern Europe will be in high demand. To support this conclusion, the author tells us that other skilled workers have left Eastern Europe and moved to Western Europe.In other words, because so many skilled workers have left, the ones who remain must be in high demand. Makes sense, right? If you were highly skilled and a bunch of your peers left, then presumably a bunch of local businesses would be competing for you to work for them.(B) weakens this argument by saying that the skilled positions have gone away. So, it's not that fewer skilled workers are available to fill the same number of jobs -- instead, there are fewer skilled workers and ALSOfewer jobsthat require skilled workers. Because there are fewer roles to fill, skilled workers may not be in such high demand.(B) is the correct answer.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

The proof is that a third world war between superpowers has not happened.Premise: Nuclear armaments in existence has kept major powers from using nuclear weapons, for fear of starting a worldwide nuclear exchange that would make the land of the power initiating it uninhabitable. The evidence for this is that no third world war has happened between superpowers yet.Conclusion:Policy of nuclear deterrence has worked thus far is unquestionable.We must find a flaw in the argument, something that weakens the conclusion that policy of nuclear deterrence has worked. So, something that shows policy has not worked and that the policy/ deterrence is not the reason for the nuclear war  not happening.(A) Maintaining a high level of nuclear armaments represents a significant drain on a country's economy: The argument already states that there were nuclear armaments in existence but they kept from using it because of the policy, so policy still works.(B) From what has happened in the past, it is impossible to infer with certainty what will happen in the future, so an accident could still trigger a third world war between superpowers. - out of scope(C) Continuing to produce nuclear weapons beyond the minimum needed for deterrence increases the likelihood of a nuclear accident.- again does not question the effectiveness of the policy, nuclear weapons are there but have not been used.(D) The major powers have engaged in many smaller-scale military operations since the end of the Second World War, while refraining from a nuclear confrontation. - it still says that they have refrained form nuclear confrontation, that is what the policy intended to do.(E) It cannot be known whether it was nuclear deterrence that worked, or some other factor, such as a recognition of the economic value of remaining at peace - this option casts a doubt on the effectiveness of the policy of nuclear deterrence. Probably there was a recognition of the economic value of peace which resulted in them not using the nuclear weapons.

But:1. What about other, non-major powers?2. What if these armaments were motivated by something other than a ""policy of nuclear deterrence,"" such as, as (E) notes, economic interests?It's a small leap, but it still is one. we don't know if the powers not at all using the weapons is why we haven't had a third WW.Support 1: the fact that there were nuclear armaments has kept major powers from using nuclear weaponsSupport 2: a third world war had not happened yet.Flaw: the main issue with this problem is that the author mistakes a correlation for causation.Slightly tricky.As for the others:(A) isn't relevant.(B) is also irrelevant because this whole question is about what has happened so far, not what will happen.(C) is out of scope because we don't even know if this is happening(D) lends support to the argument, if anything.(E) Just because we have a policy of deterrence and have yet to have a world war, it doesn't mean that the deterrence caused the lack of war.

Since the end of the Second World War, the very fact that there were nuclear armaments in existence has kept major powers from using nuclear weapons, for fear of starting a worldwide nuclear exchange that would make the land of the power initiating it uninhabitable. The proof is that a third world war between superpowers has not happened.Which one of the following, if true, indicates a flaw in the argument?(A) Maintaining a high level of nuclear armaments represents a significant drain on a country's economy.(B) From what has happened in the past, it is impossible to infer with certainty what will happen in the future, so an accident could still trigger a third world war between superpowers.(C) Continuing to produce nuclear weapons beyond the minimum needed for deterrence increases the likelihood of a nuclear accident.(D) The major powers have engaged in many smaller-scale military operations since the end of the Second World War, while refraining from a nuclear confrontation.(E) It cannot be known whether it was nuclear deterrence that worked, or some other factor, such as a recognition of the economic value of remaining atpeace.Official ExplanationThe argument commits the fallacy of false correlation. The argument assumes the fear of the destructive effects of nuclear war has prevented a nuclear exchange. It does not take into account that other factors may have affected events, such as the economic value of remaining at peace.The answer is (E)._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More That the policy of nuclear deterrence has worked thus far is unquestionable.

The key word is ""high ranking alumni"" A survey of alumni of the class of 1960 at Aurora University yielded puzzling results. When asked to indicate their academic rank, half of the respondents reported that they were in the top quarter of the graduating class in 1960.This is a resolve the paradox type of question. Both the statements provided in the stimulus are background information. The argument states that half of the respondents reported being in the top quarter of the graduating class, i.e, If there are 100 students then half of the respondents of the survey claimed that they were among the top 25. Now, this could be possible if say the respondents consisted a majority of those people only who were actually among the high ranked ones. So, this half proportion from the high ranked base could constitute a quarter of the total base (including non respondents). Suppose 50 was the respondent base and 25 of these were high ranked ones, making the proportion half. These 25 also constitute a quarter of the total 100. This is exactly provided to us by option, hence, that is the answer.Other options aren't relevant. Option B states that few respondents were mistaken about their rank. However, it will still not justify how half claimed to be in top quarter.For questions dealing with sample size, proportions, percentages, counts, it is always preferable to target the base. souvik101990A survey of alumni of the class of 1960 at Aurora University yielded puzzling results.

How can half fit into a quartile?--The discrepancy in this stimulus is that half the alumni reported they were in the top quartile of the class.See the difference? The real stimulus (the top one) is about the folks that responded to a survey. Perhaps only the smarties responded. Let's imagine there were 100 people in the class, and 50 responded to the survey. If all the top 25 students responded, that would make up half the respondents, even though they're a quarter of the whole class. This is what (A) hinges on.(B) is tempting if you thought that the solution had to be that folks were lying or delusional about their ranking. But (B) tells us that most people were correct!The negation of B could work as an explanation(C) is in some ways the reverse of (A). We need to see a higher proportion of smarties responding, not fewer of them.(D) makes the discrepancy harder to explain. If almost everyone responded, than how did a half fit into a quarter?!(E) is out of scope. Who cares how they calculated the grades? VeritasKarishma- Can you explain A answer choice here with an example.Thanks nikitamaheshwariVeritasKarishma- Can you explain A answer choice here with an example.ThanksLet me help you with that.Let's assume we have class size of 100. All received the survey link(let's say) but not all responded. For example, 50 responded. Among those, all upto top 25th rank holders responded and rest 25 were from rest of the 75 members.The above situation helps explain why such a possibility existed.HTH._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Dr. Rees rejects Dr. Tyson’s conclusion.The disagreement between the two paleontologists is over which one of the following?Dr. Tyson thinks that the evidence shows the footprints belong to early hominids due to the shape of the footprints, while Dr. Rees believes they can't belong to early hominids because of the walking pattern. Sounds like they're disagreeing over interpretations of different aspects of the evidence.(A) the relative significance of various aspects of the evidenceBingo(B) the assumption that early hominid footprints are distinguishable from other footprintsClearly they agree with that, or this disagreement wouldn't happen to begin with(C) the possibility of using the evidence of footprints to determine the gait of the creature that made those footprintsThe gait has been determined and is the evidence that Dr. Rees is using, so this is not a point of dissention(D) the assumption that evidence from one paleontologic site is enough to support a conclusionThey're both drawing conclusions, neither one is arguing that no conclusion can be drawn(E) the likelihood that early hominids would have walked upright on two feetDr. Rees didn't say anything about this possibilityWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines Dr. Tyson’s conclusion?(A) The foot prints showing human characteristics were clearly those of at least two distinct individuals.This would strengthen Dr. Tyson's conclusion by weakening Dr. Rees's, because it would open the possibility of the strange pattern of footprints being caused by two people walking in a particular fashion, causing the overlap of footprints(B) Certain species of bears had feet very like human feet, except that the outside toe on each foot was the biggest toe and the innermost toe was the smallest toe.This would explain the ""cross-stepping pattern"" - because the bear's feet look the same as a human's, except they're essentially reversed. So the footprint from the left foot would look like the right foot, and vice versa. This strengthen's Dr. Rees's position, by giving a reason to believe the footprints might belong to the bear, and thereby weakens Dr. Tyson's conclusion.(C) Footprints shaped like a human’s that do not show a cross-stepping pattern exist at site M, which is a mile away from site G, and the two sets of footprints are contemporaneous.Strengthen's Dr. Tyson's argument by showing that the cross-stepping pattern might be an anomaly(D) When the moist volcanic ash became sealed under additional layers of ash before hardening, some details of some of the footprints were erased.I originally answered this by POE until I started typing this post and realized that B is a much better answer. This doesn't really affect either argument, since both conclusions are being made from the same set of prints.(E) Most of the other footprints at site G were of animals with hooves.Totally irrelevant. This explanation is very clear and thorough!  I would just add one thing for those trying to decide between answers A) and B) on the second question.  It's important to keep track of what conclusion the scientists are arguing over: whether or not the tracks are evidence of humans.  Answer A) in the second question does not call that conclusion into question.  It just says that there might be some disagreement about HOW MANY humans there are, without questioning the conclusion that humans were present. Tyson claims they are clearly early hominid footprints since they show human characteristics: ""a squarish heel and a big toe immediately adjacent to the next toe.""(B) Certain species of bears had feet very like human feet, except that the ""outside toe on each foot was the biggest toe and the innermost toe was the smallest toe.""Even Bear has what Tyson explained. But Tyson's explanation dint have the other char of bear foot print.. Weakens the conclusion.

That is, the disagreement is about what can be inferred from the evidence, not about whether there is enough evidence to draw any conclusion.B-->, we have to make sure we understand the evidence brought up in the stimulus. It appears that the footprints discovered, though similar in shape to humans', differs in an important way: the ""left"" foot is on the right, and the ""right"" foot is on the left. As Dr. Rees says, for hominids to make those footprints, they would have to walk in a bizarre cross-stepping pattern.Now if it turns out that a certain species of bear has footprints very similar to humans', except the order of the toes is reversed, then those bears would leave footprints just like the ones in question. (Look at your feet. If your big toe and little toe switched places, your right foot would look more like a left foot, and vice versa.) So if (B) is true, then it's much more likely that the footprints were left by bears than by early hominids, so Dr. Tyson's conclusion is weakened.

This is technically an inference question, though that can be hard to see. However, we are inferring where the argument would go based on what's come before, which is no different from any question asking ""Which of the following can be inferred from the information above?""Knowing that, we just need to think about the premises that are given:1) It's unknown if BSE can be transmitted at all stages of infection.2) If it can, there is a reservoir of infected cattle incubating BSE.3) There are no diagnostic tests to identify infected animals before the animals show overt symptoms.4) Direct transmission has occurred.(A) Correct. Let's think about what would happen if we did this. Any cow/bull with symptoms will be killed. However, it will already have infected other cows, which don't yet show symptoms. So we'll never be able to get rid of the disease this way.(B) is totally plausible. If we can develop a drug that kills BSE, then we can use it to treat all the cows at once, so BSE can't be spread.(C) may be totally dramatic, but it would work. If we kill every single infected cow, then start over in an area without any BSE, we will get rid of BSE.(D) is also a great idea. If we inoculate all cows against any future BSE, then let all the infected ones die, we'll be left only with healthy cows that can't develop BSE.(E) is a big hypothetical, but if it could be accomplished, it would work. Right now, we know there isn't a diagnostic test that works to reveal cows before they show symptoms. But if we could see every single cow that had the illness, we could kill them all, and all the cows that were left would be clean.

Cause and effect type question.A : aluminium level in brainB : the disorder in brainOption B shows that A leads to B not B leads to A. vikasp99Animals with a certain behavioral disorder have unusually high level of aluminum in their brain tissue. Since a silicon-based compound binds to aluminum and prevents it from affecting the brain tissue.

There are correlation/causation issues and cause/effect issues. Let's attack them! What is going on here?We are given a fact: animals with a certain disorder have unusually high levels of aluminum in brain tissue. This is a correlation.Then we are given another fact: this compound will prevent aluminum from affecting brain tissue. Now watch this subtle jump that the argument is implying here. How do we know that the aluminum affects the brain tissue at all? Maybe it doesn't!Finally we get the conclusion: Animals can be cured of the disorder with this compound, presumably because the compound prevents aluminum from affecting brain tissue. Here is a cause and effect issue. We have no idea what causes this disorder! It could be that the weather causes this disorder and every animal who has this disorder just so happens to love eating aluminum foil. Who knows?! The main issue here though is that the argument is assuming that the aluminum is the cause and not merely the effect of the disorder.(A) We don't need to assume that the animals have ""invariable"" levels of aluminum! Maybe the amount of aluminum changes only very slightly every day. Does that change the argument? Nope.(C) ""Side effects?"" We don't care if it does/doesn't have side effects. Maybe it does! So what? Maybe it doesn't! So what? This, like (A), has no bearing on the argument.(D) This is very similar to (C). This just has no bearing on the argument. Maybe we have to put more of this compound in a dog than a cat but that doesn't really speak to the gap between getting rid of the aluminum and getting rid of the disorder.(E) This is the most tempting wrong answer. This is tempting because one may think, ""well maybe if aluminum is never present then the aluminum is the cause of the disease!"" However, this is wrong because of a few reasons: (1) it is simply not necessary! We are talking about ""unusually high levels"" of aluminum. Maybe everyone has a little bit of aluminum but not everyone has ""unusually high"" levels of it. (2) it seems to go against the premise. By saying that these animals have ""unusually high"" levels of aluminum seems to imply that animals have some level of aluminum, just not very ""unusually high"" levels.(B) Bingo. Try to negate this and it will destroy the argument. This is the initial gap that I found and it helps to alleviate it beautifully.

Under such scenarios, it is hard to interpret completely all of options.For example, D or E can causes much trouble if either of the option is changed into a sentence that contains a contradictory possibility with A.

It is a strengthen question.Facts:(1) Land-dwelling mammals needed hind limbs(2) If animals had a pelvis, they had hind limbs(3) Fossilized whale had fragile hind limbs and a partial pelvisConclusion: Fragile hind limbs are remnants of limbs that land-dwelling whales once hadSo from what is given above, we need to support the conclusion. This a problem primarily about ""evolutionary leftovers."" We know that these whales had very fragile limbs and a partial pelvis - how can we conclude that this is all pointing to them having limbs sufficient to be land-dwelling? What I was initially thinking was that I would get something about evolution. Perhaps an answer choice would say something like, ""There is evidence from fossils that date before the newly discovered fossil that whales had a stronger pelvis"" - something like that. Perhaps it would give me an example of how whales have evolved in other aspects. Either way, without having a core it is really hard to pre-phrase the right answer.(A) Well if they had full pelvises then, according to the stimulus, ""we expect them to have hind limbs."" This seems like a really good answer choice so I'll skip it and move on.(B) This actually is the opposite of what I was initially looking for. I was looking for something saying that fossils have been found that gives some evolutionary evidence that there was some hind limbs.(C) This is definitely wrong because, like (B), this makes us uncertain if we can really conclude a connection between the remnants of a limb and actually having a limb. This is saying that even scientists are uncertain as to if nonfunctioning limbs, i.e. the limbs shown in this fossilized whale, ""derived from once-functioning limbs,"" aka the land-dwelling limbs that we are trying to assert that whales use to have. Now I will say that this answer choice is still about ""other"" mammals. So it could also be treated as a bit out of scope too.(D) This is about the ability to land-dwell. Yet this isn't what we are concerned about! We are concerned about having the limbs necessary for land dwelling. We don't care if they actually land-dwelled or not - that is just a secondary tidbit of information.(E) This is just out of scope, perhaps even weakening. It seems that we are talking about sea-mammals (dolphins) now when we are really concerned about sea-mammals then. However, it may also weaken because this continues to destabilize the link between used to having functioning limbs and not having functioning limbs. We want to link up those two things as much as possible - aka that not having limbs now still doesn't necessarily mean they didn't have limbs then. As air-breathing mammals, whales must once have lived on land and needed hind limbs capable of supporting the mammals' weight. Whales have the bare remnants of a pelvis. If animals have a pelvis, we expect them to have hind limbs. A newly discovered fossilized whale skeleton has very fragile hind limbs that could not have supported the animal's weight on land.

We want to support that whales had proper hind limbs in the past. The fossil shows partial pelvis.

We know that in many assumption questions, the simplest option is the answer. If you cannot see a trap in the option, you should consider it seriously.(B) No skeletons of ancient whales with intact hind limbs capable of supporting the mammals' weight have ever been found.This makes it less likely that whales had proper hind limbs. Does not support the conclusion.(C) Scientists are uncertain whether the apparently non-functioning limbs of other early mammals derived from once-functioning limbs of their ancestors.Again, this makes our conclusion less likely. It says that scientists are uncertain whether partial limbs derived from actual limbs. Hence it suggests that scientists don't know whether connect exists between presence of partial limbs and presence of  full limbs.(D) Other large-bodied mammals like seals and sea lions manoeuvre on beaches and rocky coasts without fully functioning hind limbs.This is irrelevant because large bodied is not sufficient to say that the requirements of whales and these other mammals are the same. Perhaps whales have much more wight and hence  their requirements are different.If this option does have any relevance, it weakens our argument. We are given that whales would have needed hind limbs capable of supporting their weight on land. If there are other large-bodied mammals that make do on land without hind limbs, then it weakens that whales had hind limbs in the past. Perhaps they were able to make do without hind limbs too.(E) Some smaller sea-dwelling mammals, such as modern dolphins, have no visible indications of hind limbs.Small sea swelling animals are irrelevant.Answer (A)Another interesting strengthen question here:https://youtu.be/9o3y4Hz16es_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More",https://gmatclub.com/forum/as-air-breathing-mammals-whales-must-once-have-lived-on-land-242748.html

Hence to reduce this, large cars are a must. Its indeed a co relation though. whether fatalities or accident , the point of the assumption is that the cause is small size of the car, but that has not been proved,the best answer is based on the logic,  'remove the cause and the effect ceases',which can not be applied here. +1 CB doesn't solve the problem related to fatalities.

The passage states that cars that were built smaller after 1977 to make them more fuel-efficient had a higher incidence of accident-related fatalities than did their earlier larger counterparts. Therefore although the big cars had frequent fatal accidents, the small cars had even more. Therefore, it is not justifiable to make small cars ( i.e., more fuel efficient cars).

The executive is arguing that the smaller size of the cars is related to the higher incidence of accident-related fatalities. The fact that these cars were built smallerin order to make them more fuel efficientis not directly tied to the safety of the vehicles. The executive is not saying that fuel-efficiency is inherently dangerous -- he/she is saying that smaller vehicles have a higher incidence of accident-related fatalities. There is no reason to believe that large, fuel-efficient cars would be more dangerous than large, fuel-inefficient gas hogs.(C) tells us thatfuel-efficient cars do not have to be small. This completely erodes the reasoning behind the executive's argument -- if large cars can meet the fuel efficiency standards, then the increased incidence of fatalities in smaller cars is irrelevant in considering whether to adopt the new guidelines. For this reason, (C) constitutes a strong objection to the executive's argument.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More I also got C, but I'm not sure why A and B are wrong. omkar8275I also got C, but I'm not sure why A and B are wrong.The correct answer will pose a strong objection to the executive's argument against producing fuel efficient cars.Quote:A.

But Newton also conducted experimentssecretly for many years based on the arcane theories of alchemy,trying unsuccessfully to transmute common metals into gold and produce rejuvenatingelixirs.If the alchemists of the seventeenth century had published the results of their experiments, chemistry in the eighteenth century would have beenmore advanced than it actually was.Which one of the following assumptions would allow the conclusion concerning eighteenth-century chemistry to be properly drawn?(A) Scientific progress is retarded by the reluctance of historians to acknowledge the failures of some of the great scientists.-No mention of the role of historians, so OUT(B) Advances in science are hastened when reports of experiments, whether successful or not, are available for review by other scientists.I have highlighted 'trying unsuccessfully' and 'alchemists...published' - basically he was trying to replicate or repeat their work unsuccessfully. So if alchemists had chronicled their findings it would have helped Newton(C) Newton's work on motion and gravity would not have gained wide acceptance if the results of his work in alchemy had also been made public.Irrelevant(D) Increasing specialization-within the sciences makes it difficult for scientists in one field to understand the principles of other fields.No mention of it anywhere(E) The seventeenth-century alchemists could have achieved their goals only if their experiments had been subjected to public scrutiny.How do we conclude this statement? so OUT Padminiprasad9Can someone please explain why B is the answer and not E?The author concludes that ""if the alchemists of the seventeenth century had published the results of their experiments, chemistry in the eighteenth century would have been more advanced than it actually was."" We need an answer choice that explains why publishing those results would have advanced chemistry in the eighteenth century.Quote:(E) The seventeenth-century alchemists could have achieved their goals only if their experiments had been subjected to public scrutiny.Choice (E) suggests thatalchemycould have been more advanced if the alchemists of the seventeenth century had published the results of their experiments. But we need to explain why publishing the results ofalchemyexperiments might have benefited the field ofchemistry. Choice (E) is not relevant to the author's conclusion and can be eliminated.Quote:(B) Advances in science are hastened when reports of experiments, whether successful or not, are available for review by other scientists.We know that Newton conducted alchemy experiments in secret. The author concludes that publishing the results of such experiments would have contributed to the field of chemistry. But is this a logical conclusion, even if those experiments were unsuccessful?Choice (B) explains that publishing the results of such experiments WOULD have hastened advances in science (i.e. chemistry), even if the experiments were not successful. Thus, publishing the results of unsuccessful alchemy experiments, such as those conducted in secret by Newton, would have advanced the field of chemistry.This explains the author's conclusion, so choice (B) is the best answer._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Gmat1008The seventeenth-century physicist Sir Isaac Newton is remembered chiefly for his treatises on motion and gravity. But Newton also conducted experiments secretly for many years based on the arcane theories of alchemy, trying unsuccessfully to transmute common metals into gold and produce rejuvenating elixirs. If the alchemists of the seventeenth century had published the results of their experiments, chemistry in the eighteenth century would have been more advanced than it actually was.Which one of the following assumptions would allow the conclusion concerning eighteenth-century chemistry to be properly drawn?(A) Scientific progress is retarded by the reluctance of historians to acknowledge the failures of some of the great scientists.(B) Advances in science are hastened when reports of experiments, whether successful or not, are available for review by other scientists.(C) Newton's work on motion and gravity would not have gained wide acceptance if the results of his work in alchemy had also been made public.(D) Increasing specialization-within the sciences makes it difficult for scientists in one field to understand the principles of other fields.(E) The seventeenth-century alchemists could have achieved their goals only if their experiments had been subjected to public scrutiny.#LSATThe argument concludes that eighteenth century chemistry would have been more advanced than it was if seventeenth century alchemists would have published the results of their experiments. Why? We're told that there were seventeenth century alchemists (of whom Newton is listed as an example) who conducted experiments. We're not told that any of these alchemists' experiments were successful, just that they had conducted some unsuccessful experiments.We're asked to find a link that would ensure the argument's conclusion is properly drawn. Answer choice (B) builds a bridge between publishing experiments (successful or not) and advances in science. One can speculate as to why publicizing unsuccessful experiments would have advanced science, though it's not needed based on the argument. For example, if Newton had published his unsuccessful, maybe there would have been less alchemists trying to conduct the same experiments who could have then been working on new approaches that would have led to advances in science. The reason why is really not important for this argument.Incorrect Answers(A) does not address the lack of publication of scientific research. The reluctance of historians to acknowledge the failures of great scientists is irrelevant. The important thing is whether the publication of research would have led to advances in science.(C) undermines the conclusion by suggesting that Newton's important science would have been questioned if he had published his less credible research.(D) is out of scope. The argument never mentions increasing specialization in science.(E) places a requirement on the success of alchemists but does nothing to ensure the advance of science. So, here we need to find out the assumption which leads to the conclusion that if the alchemists of the seventeenth century had published the results of their experiments, chemistry in the eighteenth century would have been more advanced than it actually was.On negating, Advances in science are hastened when reports of experiments, whether successful or not, are available for review by other scientists, the statement looks like Advances in science arenothastened when reports of experiments, whether successful or not, are available for review by other scientistsThe conclusion is demolished, henceBis the answer.

""It was a meteorite!"" the conclusion says. How can we weaken this? Pretty easily actually. All we have to do is show that it was actually something else that caused this ""huge cloud of iridium-laden dust"" to form the layer of iridium-rich rock.(A) This just talks more about the huge dust cloud. We don't want to know what effect the dust cloud had; we want to know what caused the dust cloud to begin with.(B) But does this mean that it was/wasn't the meteorite that caused the iridium in the dust cloud? We don't know! All we know is that rock takes millions of years to harden. Okay....(C) This functions much like (A). We don't care about any effects of the rock. AKA, we don't care how sedimentary rock is used. We care about what caused the iridium in the sedimentary rock.(D) This looks great! (D) basically says, ""nope. It wasn't the meteorite that caused the iridium. It was actually the matter spewed from the volcanoes."" In other words, this provides an alternate cause and that is exactly what we wanted to do!(E) This actually strengthens the conclusion! It does so by giving more credence to the idea that it was a meteorite that caused the iridium dust. Why? Well it says that the iridium formed at about the same time as mass dinosaur extinctions. So what? This is important because many people believe that the dinosaurs were extinct because of, you guessed it...a meteorite! While it doesn't conclusively prove that a meteorite caused the iridium in the rock. It shows that it seems to be correlated with another event that involved a meteorite. Hmm.... Either way, this definitely does not weaken the argument.

"Whenever a major political scandal erupts before an election and voters blame the scandal on all parties about equally, virtually all incumbents, from whatever party, seeking reelection are returned to office. However, when voters blame such a scandal on only one party, incumbents from that party are likely to be defeated by challengers from other parties. The proportion of incumbents who seek reelection is high and remarkably constant from election to election.If the voters’ reactions are guided by a principle, which one of the following principles would best account for the contrast in reactions described above?(A) Whenever one incumbent is responsible for one major political scandal and another incumbent is responsible for another, the consequences for the two incumbents should be the same.(B) When a major political scandal is blamed on incumbents from all parties, that judgment is more accurate than any judgment that incumbents from only on party are to blame.(C) Incumbents who are rightly blamed for a major political scandal should not seek reelection, but if they do, they should not be returned to office.(D) Major political scandals can practically always be blamed on incumbents, but whether those incumbents should be voted out of office depends on who their challengers are.(E) When major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong, whatever party was responsible must be penalized when possible.Show SpoilerOECheckGMATNinja's explanationHEREHere is the OE from Kaplan:The roster of facts is tough to get through: Handle with care, and keep paraphrasing. When voters blame a scandal equally on all parties, almost all incumbents win reelection. But when a scandal is blamed on a single party, incumbents from that party tend to lose. (E)’s principle would explain such behavior. According to (E), if Party X is responsible for a scandal, voters should try to punish Party X by voting out its incumbents; however, if all the parties are responsible, there’s not much voters can do—whoever they vote for would be a member of one of the offending parties, so they might as well vote for the incumbents. Thus (E) accounts for the contrast in voter reactions.(A) deals with what should happen to individual incumbents who are responsible for scandals, but the stimulus just describes how voters treat parties or incumbents as members of their parties.(B) makes a judgment about the likely accuracy of the judgments of blame, but nothing of the kind is mentioned in the passage.(C) makes the mistake of concentrating on individuals, instead of parties. Moreover, (C) runs contrary to the passage: According to (C), in cases where all parties are blamed for a scandal, all incumbents should be turned out.(D) The passage doesn’t imply that voters evaluate the challengers. On the contrary, voters are depicted as making choices depending on what they believe about the incumbents’ parties.The question stem asks for a principle that would account for voter actions. The last sentence has nothing to do with voter’s actions, so it is essentially filler used to create wrong answer choices.The more complex a stimulus, the more important it is to paraphrase carefully. Don’t get bogged down in the author’s verbiage; instead, replace it with your own everyday language and images.­ShowHideAnswerOfficial AnswerOfficial Answer and Stats are available only to registered users.Register/Login.","Let's say that the mayor of a town always belongs to one of three political parties: X, Y, or Z. The town holds an election every year, voting either to keep the incumbent mayor (if that mayor runs for reelection) or to elect a new mayor.Quote:Whenever a major political scandal erupts before an election and voters blame the scandal on all parties about equally, virtually all incumbents, from whatever party, seeking reelection are returned to office.(Scenario 1): According to this statement, if a major political scandal erupts before one of the annual elections and voters blame the scandal on all three parties about equally, then the incumbent mayor, if seeking reelection, will almost certainly win the election, regardless of the mayor's political party affiliation. In other words, even though the incumbent belongs to a party that is equally blamed for the scandal, the incumbent and his/her party do not suffer negative political consequences.Quote:However, when voters blame such a scandal on only one party, incumbents from that party are likely to be defeated by challengers from other parties.(Scenario 2): If the current mayor belongs to Party X, and voters blame the scandal on Party X, the current mayor, if seeking reelection, is likely to be defeated by a challenger from Party Y or Party Z. In other words, when the incumbent's party is the ONLY party blamed, the incumbent and his/her party DO suffer negative political consequences.Now on to the question stem:Quote:If the voters’ reactions are guided by a principle, which one of the following principles would best account for the contrast in reactions described above?The ""voters' reactions"" are described in the first two sentences: scenario 1) when voters blame a pre-election scandal on all parties equally, the incumbent usually wins, and scenario 2) when voters blame a pre-election scandal on the party of the incumbent, the incumbent usually loses. If we are told that those reactions are guided by a principle, which principle would best account for the contrast in those reactions?Quote:(A) Whenever one incumbent is responsible for one major political scandal and another incumbent is responsible for another, the consequences for the two incumbents should be the same.The argument in the passage does not discuss how the voters would react if one incumbent were responsible for one major scandal and another incumbent were responsible for another. Choice (A) can be eliminated.Quote:(B) When a major political scandal is blamed on incumbents from all parties, that judgment is more accurate than any judgment that incumbents from only on party are to blame.We are looking for a principle that accounts for the contrast in the voters' reactions (scenario 1 vs scenario 2), and we don't care whether the judgment on which one reaction is based is more accurate than the judgment on which the other is based. Choice (B) can be eliminated.Quote:(C) Incumbents who are rightly blamed for a major political scandal should not seek reelection, but if they do, they should not be returned to office.First, the passage does not consider whether incumbents blamed for a major political scandal should or should not seek reelection. Second, choice (C) only explains the voters' reaction in scenario 2 and does NOT explain thecontrastin those reactions. Choice (C) can be eliminated.Quote:(D) Major political scandals can practically always be blamed on incumbents, but whether those incumbents should be voted out of office depends on who their challengers are.This statement does not align with the information in the passage. According to the passage, if incumbents (and hence their parties) are blamed for a pre-election scandal, those incumbents will most likely lose the election, regardless of ""who their challengers are."" Choice (D) can be eliminated.Quote:(E) When major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong, whatever party was responsible must be penalized when possible.First, apply this principle to scenario 2 (the incumbent's party--Party X, for example--receives all of the blame): in that case, Party X can easily be penalized by voting for someone in Party Y or Party Z. Now, consider scenario 1 (for example, the incumbent belongs to Party X but Parties X, Y, and Z all receive equal blame): if we follow the principle in statement (E), we should penalize ALL parties. If we vote for someone in Party Y or Z, one of those parties is rewarded while party X is penalized. There is no way to penalize all parties equally since a member of one of the parties has to win. In that case, the voters might just stick with the default option (the incumbent). Thus, choice (E) is the best choice._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More gmatfighter12I picked A and could not quite understand why it was E.

The spotting here is that an incumbent is member (part) of a party (whole). If you've done this, just ask yourself these 2 questions:If a certain Part has an attribute, is it necessary that the Whole has it?If the Whole has a quality, is it necessary that each part has it?Since the stimulus is a principle q, voters seem to adhere to q1 above and hence answer E.You can use sports as a 'Parts of the Whole' analogy to see this: Phillies is the best team in the MLB. Therefore all its pitchers are the best pitchers in MLB. Is that logically right? IMO E.Other options go beyond the scope.Could someone please explain the meaning of below phrases.

And I found this(E) When major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong,(scandal is blamed on the party, not the incumbent) whatever party was responsible must be penalized when possible (but if both are responsible then the incumbent will not necessarily be penalized).https://www.top-law-schools.com/archives ... =6&t=44835 The argument says that when all parties are involved in the scandal no particular member of any party suffers the consequences but when a single party is involved the incumbents belonging to that party suffers defeat in the hand of the challengers.""E"" says that an incumbent is the member of a party. If the party is scandalised it does not imply each and every single incumbent is involved in the scandal or vice versa if the incumbent is to be blamed for the scandal then since the incumbent is the part of a party the whole party takes the responsibility._________________Aryama Dutta SaikiaJamboree Education Pvt.

Let's see if we can definitively get rid of four wrong answers.(A) is out of scope. We care about what happens when a political party is blamed for a scandal, not about what happens if two individual incumbents are equally to blame for something.(B) is likewise out of scope. Accuracy of judgments has nothing to do with the stimulus, and this answer choice doesn't explain why voters vote the way they do.(C) is out because the stimulus never touches on whether incumbents should seek reelection; further, the statements are about when a party, not an individual, is blamed.(D) is out because the statements never suggest that the identity of the challenger is significant.So that leaves us with (E). It may look a little funky, but it gets us where we need to go: when major political scandals are blamed on a particular party, that party must be penalized, i.e., its incumbents must suffer. This explains the voter behavior outlined in the stimulus.Answer is E manishtank1988My 2 cents:Whole (party scandal) ----x---> Party’s individual membersIndividual member (scandal) ---> Party’s ALL membersSo what happens to whole DOES NOT impact the part i.e. individual members BUT what happens to part DOES impact the whole i.e. ALL the members of party.ONLY E resembles this condition!!!This is why I chose this answer so confidently. The paradox is between the political parties not the politicians of the political parties. DearIanStewartI would be much grateful if you could help me with the following excerpt of E: “major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong”Is this another way of saying “individual incumbents are less responsible for the scandal than are parties” ?The wording of the excerpt is quite confusing and I don’t get how it means what it means. Could you please check whether I am doing a correct analogue?She is my colleague. She is also my friend.She is more my friend than she is my colleague.Or: She is less my colleague than she is my friend.Scandals are the responsibility of individual incumbents.

Answer E is outlining a principle that only applies when a scandal is attributable to a party, rather than to an individual person. If I understood correctly your post, that's the meaning you took from it, so I think yes, you were on the right track.Incidentally, that's the key to answering this question quickly. The stem only talks about scandals that can be attributed either to one party, or to all parties. It never even discusses scandals that can be attributed to a single individual. So whatever principle voters are using here, it must be one that covers the case where a party or parties are responsible for a scandal. Any answer that describes what voters do when individuals are responsible for scandals is immediately wrong. That only leaves answer E, and maybe answer D, but D is clearly wrong because we know that when a party is responsible for a scandal, voters do not care at all ""who the challenger is"" to an incumbent in the scandal-ridden party -- voters will pick the challenger.I still don't think E is a perfect answer, however. We're asked for a principle that explains the 'contrast' outlined in the stem, a contrast between voting behaviours in two different situations. Answer E certainly explains why voters pick challengers when an incumbent belongs to a scandal-ridden party. But it doesn't explain well the part of the stem that is more surprising: why do incumbents almost always win when there is a major political scandal involving all parties? That's the part of the stem that seems to need explanation to me (if politics is full of scandal, I'd think voters would be more likely to vote for new people), but answer E doesn't help explain that at all, and the question does ask us to explain it, so no answer is great here. But E is the only answer that's even remotely relevant to the stem, and it explains half of the contrast, so it's clearly the best answer.Posted from my mobile device_________________now teaching gmat focusianstewartgmat.comSignature Read More IanStewartJonShukhratDearIanStewartI would be much grateful if you could help me with the following excerpt of E: “major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong”You could imagine, in a political context, at least three possible situations:- an individual politician (an 'incumbent', when the next election comes up) is responsible for a scandal -- maybe he or she stole taxpayer money to buy a yacht- an individual party is responsible for a scandal -- maybe the party fundraised promising to run election advertising but instead funded an expensive party conference on a distant island paradise- all parties are responsible for a scandal -- maybe every party has been breaking a law that forbids advertising during children's television programmingWhen answer E talks about scandals that are more the responsibility of a party than of an individual, answer E is ruling out the first possible case above.

That's the part of the stem that seems to need explanation to me (if politics is full of scandal, I'd think voters would be more likely to vote for new people), but answer E doesn't help explain that at all, and the question does ask us to explain it, so no answer is great here. But E is the only answer that's even remotely relevant to the stem, and it explains half of the contrast, so it's clearly the best answer.Posted from my mobile deviceHeyIanStewart, when I read option D, I thought it made sense particularly because of the part that says ""who their challengers are."". If the challengers are also scandalous, the voters just let the incumbents be. If the challengers are not scandalous, the voters vote the incumbents out. Although far from perfect, option D seems to touch on both the situations.It would be interesting to know what you think. I truly appreciate your no-BS posts across forum! Brian123HeyIanStewart, when I read option D, I thought it made sense particularly because of the part that says ""who their challengers are."". If the challengers are also scandalous, the voters just let the incumbents be. If the challengers are not scandalous, the voters vote the incumbents out. Although far from perfect, option D seems to touch on both the situations.It would be interesting to know what you think. I truly appreciate your no-BS posts across forum!I do see what you mean, and if it were reworded slightly, D might be an answer worth considering here. But I think it's important to distinguish between two situations in this question: the situation where a scandal is blamed on one or more political parties (that's the only situation discussed in the stem) and the situation where a scandal is blamed on a single person, for example the 'incumbent' described in answer D. As worded, answer D can't explain the behaviour in the stem, because answer D doesn't tell us anything about how voters respond when scandals are blamed on one party, or on several parties -- it only describes how voters respond when a scandal is blamed on a single person. If D instead said something like ""the incumbent's party can always be blamed, at least in part, for any scandal, and since voters only vote for scandalous parties when they can't avoid it, the identity of the challenger matters"" then D would at least explain half of the stem.Notice that answer E instead focuses on the correct situation: the situation where the party, not the person, is responsible for the scandal. But as I said above, I still don't think any answer choice is perfect here, because no answer explains the most surprising behaviour described in the stem (why incumbents always win when everyone is embroiled in scandal)._________________now teaching gmat focusianstewartgmat.comSignature Read More As per E When  incumbents responsibility  for political scandal <   party responsibility  for political scandal => Party must be penalizedwhen one party is blamed specifically, the individual incumbents are affected as people will not choose them and they have an option to choose folks from other parties.But when party is blamed equally , you cant penalize all parties as someone must be elected.

The argument can be reduced to this paraphrase: ""because government-funded artwork can't reflect independent artistic conscience, government funding cannot lead to creation of works with artistic excellence"" or ""because no ind. art consc., no artistic excellence.""Quote:This is actually a common form of argument: ""because no A, no B"". In this kind of argument, the arguer is assuming that A is necessary for B. We can use the denial test to see this: if A wasn't necessary for B, then the argument (that no A means no B) falls apart. Thus, the argument's reasoning depends on A being necessary for B. Here, the ""A"" is independent artistic conscience and the ""B"" is (true) artistic excellence. So, the author is assuming that independent artistic conscience is necessary for (true) artistic excellence. If we went into the answer choices with this prediction and then scanned for a match, then choice E clearly matches._________________My Stuff:Four Years to 760|MBA Trends for Indian ApplicantsMy GMAT ResourcesV30-V40: How to do it!|GMATPrep SC|GMATPrep CR|GMATPrep RC|Critical Reasoning Megathread|CR: Numbers and Statistics|CR: Weaken|CR: Strengthen|CR: Assumption|SC: Modifier|SC: Meaning|SC: SV Agreement|RC: Primary Purpose|PS/DS: Numbers and Inequalities|PS/DS: Combinatorics and CoordinatesMy MBA ResourcesEverything about the MBA Application|Over-Represented MBA woes|Fit Vs Rankings|Low GPA: What you can do|Letter of Recommendation: The Guide|Indian B Schools accepting GMAT score|Why MBA?My ReviewsHow I got into five schools from zero - Applicant Lab ReviewVeritas Prep Live OnlineSignature Read More The stated goal of the government's funding program for the arts is to encourage the creation of works of artistic excellence.

Similarly, the Senator can make a claim denying that govt-funded work is artistically excellent without having to believe that there is broad agreement as to what that standard is. Finally, ""the distribution of funds"" being based on the broad agreement of excellence goes beyond anything mentioned.(D) There's no reason the Senator has to assume this extreme, sweeping claim.

(B) out.Quote:(C) Distribution of government funds for the arts is based on a broad agreement as to what constitutes artistic excellence.Tbh. I don't know how does this fit into the reasoning. (C) is out.Quote:(D) Once an artist has produced works of true artistic excellence, he or she will never accept government funding.This is a really strong statement. This does not have to be true. The statement only stated that Artist who received financial support will try to please them. (D) is out.Quote:(E) A contemporary work of art that does not reflect the independent artistic conscience of the artist cannot be a work of true artistic excellence.This connects the point that was discussed earlier.Only E is left.

So anyone outside the neighborhood has an option to move in there and make it happen. Out of the 5 answers B is the one that better allows parents that can't afford  tuition to send their kids there._________________GMAT loosers are born not made !!!Signature Read More School superintendent: It is a sad fact that, until now, entry into the academically best high school in our district has been restricted to the children of people who were wealthy enough to pay the high tuition. Parents who were previously denied the option of sending their children to this school now have this option, since I am replacing the tuition requirement with a requirement that allows only those who live in the neighborhood of the school to attend.Situation: only wealthy enough to pay the high tuition -> accept to best high schoolPlan: Replacing tuition requirement that allows only those who live in the neighborhood -> those who were denied now can attend.There is no GAP that needs to be filled, so we should look for defender assumption, the alternate possibility that the plan might go off the rail.The superintendent's claim about the effect of replacing the tuition requirement relies on the assumption thatQuote:(A) the residents of the school's neighborhood tend to be wealthyThis has nothing to do with those who were denied. (A) is out.Quote:(B) people other than those wealthy enough to have paid the old tuition are able to live in the neighborhood of the schoolSounds promising.

Hang on to this.Quote:(D) there are no high schools in the district other than the one referred to by the superintendentWe are only care about 1 school. Other schools are irrelevant. (D) is out.Quote:(E) there are many people not wealthy enough to have paid the old tuition who wish to have their children attend the schoolBut do they meet the requirement? Yes and No? Then this assumption is not required. (E) is out.Down to (B) and (C). What is the difference between the two answer choices?(B) is saying that those who are not wealthy enough to pay for tuition are ABLE to live in the neighborhood of the school. This means that if you are not able to live there, you won't be able to attend the school. So this must be true, otherwise the change of the tuition does not change the situation at all.(C) is saying that those who are not wealthy enough to pay for tuition are in the MAJORITY in the district. This leaves the possibility that even if those people are in the minority, 50%, or majority, they will still be able to attend now because of the change. Hence, (C) does not necessarily have to be true.(B) is our answer._________________Consistency and Discipline beats Talent.Signature Read More The argument talks that ""the people who previously applied but couldn't get admission because they were not wealthy enough might have a chance now because the criteria changed from wealthy enough to people who live in the neighbhourhood.Between B and E.E talks about people who wish to apply ( we don't know did they apply before or not. Secondly, we don't know where they live. Because what matters is people who applied and also live near the neighborhood. Hence B.

Imo EA very simple question , gives us a different reason for the finding. broallSeveral studies have shown that hospitals are not all equally successful: patients are much more likely to die in some of them than in others. Since the hospitals in the studies had approximately equal per-patient funding, differences in the quality of care provided by hospital staff are probably responsible for the differences in mortality rates.Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the conclusion drawn above?(A) The staff in some of the hospitals studied had earned more advanced degrees, on average, than the staff in the other hospitals.(B) Patient populations vary substantially in average severity of illness from hospital to hospital.(C) The average number of years that staff members stay on at a given job varies considerably from one hospital to another.(D) Approximately the same surgical procedures were performed in each of the hospitals covered in the studies.(E) Mortality rates for hospital patients do not vary considerably from one region of the country to another.-Patients are more likely to die in some hospitals than others-Hospitals have about equal per-patient funding-Mortality rate difference is because of differences in the quality of careMore people die at some people than others...it MUST BE because of the doctors' differing quality of care . Instead of thinking that way, maybe we should actually look more into the type of people that are going into these hospitals. Maybe some hospitals happen to be given more terminal cases than others. Maybe some hospitals that are in the inner-city typically get more cases of violence than those in rural communities. There are so many differences that we could attribute to the differing mortality rates. It seems that the patients would explain these differences; not the doctors.(A) Yea okay this is decent. It shows that there are some hospitals that have personnel with more training or skills. However, does this necessarily equate to a difference in the quality of care? What if these advanced degrees were in philosophy and English? . The point is that having MORE advanced degrees does not equal MORE quality care. Even if it did, it would actually strengthen the argument rather than weaken it!(B) gives us this alternate cause! What is it? It says that the average severity of illness varies from hospital to hospital. This means that some hospitals simply have more dire cases than other hospitals. A hospital that primarily deals with stuffy noses will not have more deaths than a hospital that primarily deals with ICU patients. (B) thus weakens the idea that it is the quality of care that leads to a difference in mortality rates by saying, ""nope! It is actually the patients that lead to diverging mortality rates. We are all awesome! (okay I added that last part in)""(C) This functions kind of like (A). It just gives us a random fact that doesn't seemingly have anything to do with debunking the quality of care conclusion. We don't know what affect the ""average number of years that staff members stay on"" has on the argument.(D) This actually strengthens the argument just a bit. If we say that the same surgical procedures are being done then maybe the only differentiating factor IS actually the doctors/nurses performing the care. Thus maybe would COULD say that it is the doctors and nurses that provide that differing quality of care that leads to the differing mortality rates.(E) This one is odd. It is kind of a premise de-booster because, while it shows that mortality rates DO vary, they don't ""vary considerably."" Now we don't really know how much they vary but none of this really matters. The point is that it says nothing about what actually affects the mortality rates. It just says that the mortality rates are different.

It is not certain, however, that lowering entrance standards will avert a shortage. It is clear that with either a shortage of nurses or lowered entrance standards of the profession, the current high quality of health care cannot be maintained.Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?(A) If the nursing profession solves the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions, it will attract able applicants in greater numbers than it currently does.(B) The nursing profession will have to lower its entrance standards if the pool of able applicants to nursing school does not increase beyond the current level.(C) If the nursing profession solves the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions, high quality health care will be maintained.(D) If the nursing profession fails to solve the problems of low wages and high stress working conditions, there will soon be an acute shortage of nurses.(E) The current high quality of health care will not be maintained if the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions in the nursing profession are no solved.Given:'Solving low wages problem' is necessary for 'attracting more applicants to nursing school'(Note that 'Unless A, B' is equivalent to 'Only if A, then not B')If no. of applicants doesn't increase, one of 2 things will certainly happen - either 'lower entrance standards' or 'shortage of nurses'Even lowering entrance standards may not avert shortage (or it may avert shortages)If either of these two things happens, current high quality will fall.Look at the options now.(A) If the nursing profession solves the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions, it will attract able applicants in greater numbers than it currently does.'Solving low wages problem' is NECESSARY for 'attracting more applicants to nursing school', not SUFFICIENT.(B) The nursing profession will have to lower its entrance standards if the pool of able applicants to nursing school does not increase beyond the current level.If no. of applicants doesn't increase, one of 2 things will certainly happen. So it is not necessary that the profession will have to lower its entrance standards. It could suffer shortage too instead.(C) If the nursing profession solves the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions, high quality health care will be maintained.Again, 'Solving low wages problem' is NECESSARY for 'attracting more applicants to nursing school', not SUFFICIENT. So we don't even know whether more applicants will be attracted, let alone whether high quality care will be maintained.(D) If the nursing profession fails to solve the problems of low wages and high stress working conditions, there will soon be an acute shortage of nurses.If the 'low wages' problem is not solved, number of candidates applying will not increase. Then one possibility is shortage but the other is lowering entrance standards. Lowering entrance standards may not avert shortages, but it may. Hence we cannot say that there WILL BE shortage.(E) The current high quality of health care will not be maintained if the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions in the nursing profession are no solved.Correct. Resolving low wages is necessary to increase applicants. If we do not resolve low wages, number of applicants will not increase. Then either there will be shortage or lower entrance standards. In both these cases, high quality will be lost.Hence current high quality will not be maintained if the low wages issue is not sorted.Answer (E)Check the video on necessary and sufficient conditions here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmlwcTlHZz8_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More kittleAmoyVNursing schools cannot attract a greater number of able applicants than they currently do unless the problems of low wages and high-stress working conditions in the nursing profession are solved.

The archaeologist's aren't trying to determine, for example, that the tombs are 450 years old or something. They are trying to determine the relative ages of the tombs -- that is, the age of the tombs in relation to one another (which tomb is oldest, second oldest, etc.).We want an answer choice that helps explain how they were able to use tree rings to do this. We know that the tombs used freshly cut logs and that all the trees came from the same valley.(A) says nothing about tree rings.(B) says the trees in the valley are distinct from other trees. It seems close, but ultimately won't help us. We already know that the tombs were made from trees in the valley.(C) helps. If each of the trees has this distinct pattern of 6, 3, 3, then we can use that pattern to judge the relative ages of the trees, and thus the relative ages of the tombs. For example, a tree with 10 rings after the distinctive set grew to be older than a tree with only 4 rings after the distinctive set.(D) doesn't help us determine the relative ages of the tombs.(E) doesn't help us determine the relative ages of the tombs.

With your reasoning we could determine relative ages of trees but not relative ages of tombs. For example imagine tomb x is the last (newest) tomb but made of a tree that has the greatest number of rings (and sequence). From your reasoning it follows that this tomb must be the oldest tomb.Answer choice (C) means that there was one distinct period of time in which there were 6 drought years followed by 3 rainy years followed by 3 drought years. Knowing this will allow to determine relative ages of TOMBS.Tomb 1 - 10D+3R+3D+6 other ringsThis means that tomb was made 6 years after the certain period, tomb 2 x years after the special sequence, and so on.

The requirement in many jurisdictions that automobiles pass emission-control inspections has had the effect of taking many such automobiles out of service in the United States, as they fail inspection and their owners opt to buy newer automobiles. Thus the burden of pollution such older United States automobiles contribute to the global atmosphere will be gradually reduced over the next decade.In a weaken q, start with conclusion:The burden of pollution that such (ie those automobiles which failed inspection tests) older United States automobiles contribute to the global atmosphere will be gradually reduced over the next 10 yearsWhy?Because as per author, a recent jurisdiction has been passed which states:1. Older automobiles which do not pass emission-control inspections will be discontinued to drive.2. People will have to opt to buy new vehicles, and new vehicles will not cause as much pollution as old ones.So I am pre-thinking: What if new vehicles have some maintenance issue that leadsto air pollution.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?. . .Quote:(C) There is a thriving market for used older Untied States automobiles that are exported to regions that have no emission-control regulations.But I am not concerned with: What is happening in US?

Whether people are torn between C and E or just prefer E, the common theme is that E undermines the conclusion.Not really.I can see why people may think it does. Option E seems to have the cues that many methods train us to find.Option E does address the issue of the old vehicles. It does contain the words ""pollution"" and ""increase"" and the phrase ""U.S. automobiles.""On the other hand, superficially, option E does not mention an increase inglobalair pollution. That fact alone is not enough to reject E.E shifts the focus to future cars. That move might be legitimate . . . if only the language were definitive.Option E's language is not definitive at all. Not even a little bit.Option E is a conditional statement signaled by the word ""if."" The language isspeculative.Option E discusses a POSSIBLE condition and a probable result. The modal verbs ""could"" and ""should"" are red flags that convey ""nothing definite here!""We have a statement that air pollution-- COULD still increase . . .-- IF total vehicle use . . .-- SHOULD (hypothetically WERE TO) increase ""significantly.""I read option E and thought, ""Spineless. Wishy-washy. How do we know whether these big IFs will happen? We don't.""That language is too uncertain and cautious to do any harm, never mind to ""seriously weaken"" the conclusion.

This does not weaken the argument.(C) There is a thriving market for used older Untied States automobiles that are exported to regions that have no emission-control regulations.This option clearly states that if there is thriving market for the used old automobiles in the regions where there are no regulations then these automobiles will continue to contribute to the air pollution and thus the pollution will not be reduced in the next decade. This option clearly weakens our argument.(D) The number of jurisdictions in the United States requiring automobiles to pass emission-control inspections is no longer increasing.Does not weaken the argument. In fact has no effect on the argument.(E) Even if all the older automobiles in the United States were retired from service, air pollution from United States automobiles could still increase if the total number ofautomobiles in use should increase significantly.This is a good trap answer. IMO, the argument here is only concerned about the pollution caused by older automobiles as mentioned in the premise of the argument. This option says that the air pollution from United States automobiles could increase if the number of automobiles in use increase. If this is true then the air pollution in US is definitely going to increase but this does not weaken the argument because the increased pollution will be attributable to the new or perhaps the existing cars but not to the old cars the argument talked about. We somehow need to prove that the pollution caused by old automobiles will not be reduced or increased over the next decade.So we can eliminate this choice.Hope it helpsArunabh vikasp99Older United States automobiles have been identified as contributing disproportionately to global air pollution. The requirement in many jurisdictions that automobiles pass emission-control inspections has had the effect of taking many such automobiles out of service in the United States, as they fail inspection and their owners opt to buy newer automobiles. Thus the burden of pollution such older United States automobiles contribute to the global atmosphere will be gradually reduced over the next decade.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) It is impossible to separate the air of one country or jurisdiction from that of others.(B) When automobiles that are now new become older, they will, because of a design change, cause less air pollution than older automobiles do now.(C) There is a thriving market for used older Untied States automobiles that are exported to regions that have no emission-control regulations.(D) The number of jurisdictions in the United States requiring automobiles to pass emission-control inspections is no longer increasing.(E) Even if all the older automobiles in the United States were retired from service, air pollution from United States automobiles could still increase if the total number of automobiles in use should increase significantly.-Many jurisdictions require cars to pass emissions-This has caused cars that fail inspection to get off the road while owners buy newer cars-The burden of pollution of older U.S. cars will be gradually reduced over the next decadeThis argument is assuming that the older vehicles, while taken off the road in jurisdictions with such emissions standards, are NOT going elsewhere. The stimulus only said that ""many"" jurisdictions are requiring these emissions tests - this doesn't tell us much! Perhaps ""many"" is only 5% of the U.S. while this argument is talking about the entire ""burden of pollution"" of older U.S. vehicles. With that said, it is important to note that we actually don't care too much about the newer vehicles. Why? Because the conclusion is strictly talking about ""older United States automobiles."" Therefore, knowing that ""newer U.S. automobiles are terrible for the environment and will result in our demise"" would actually do us no good for the purposes of this argument.(A) So? Does this say anything about older U.S. cars? Nope.(B) This actually might strengthen the argument, if anything, by showing that newer cars will be better for the environment always. However, this still doesn't say anything about older cars and that is what we need.(C) Yes! If there is a ""thriving market"" of people waiting to buy these older U.S. cars then we can safely question that the burden of pollution will be reduced. If anything, the burden of pollution would stay roughly the same BECAUSE do not actually seem to be ceasing existence. They are still going to be driven! Thus, the pollution in the global atmosphere should be about the same as it was before.(D) Tricky! However, this doesn't really do too much. This seems to say that the number of jurisdictions are staying the same. Without making any additional assumptions, this seems to neither strengthen nor weaken the argument. If the same jurisdictions are going to be requiring the test - and no more - then why would we question the conclusion that the older U.S. automobiles will be contributing less pollution to the globe? It seems fairly reasonable. HOWEVER, if this answer choice had actually said that the number of jurisdictions were ""sharply decreasing"" then you might be onto something here...(E) This might weaken but the problem is that we would have to make another assumption to make this so. We would have to assume that the ""total number of automobiles in use"" actually do ""increase significantly."" This is something we know nothing about so I would be hesitant to pick this answer! We have no idea how many cars will be on the road. gmatexam439generisnightblade354pikolo2510ammuseeruHarshgmatGMATNinjaMy query is regarding choosing E over C.Quote:Older United States automobiles have been identified as contributing disproportionately to global air pollution.

Whether people are torn between C and E or just prefer E, the common theme is that E undermines the conclusion.Not really.I can see why people may think it does. Option E seems to have a lot of cues many methods train us to find.Option E does address the issue of the old vehicles.

That fact alone is not enough to reject E.E shifts the focus to future cars. That move might be legitimate . . . if only the language were definitive.Option E's language is not definitive at all. Not even a little bit.Option E is a conditional statement signaled by the word ""if."" The language isspeculative.Option E discusses a POSSIBLE condition and a probable result.

But [V] do not [do]. Therefore, [V] is not [A].Now the argument with option ""A"":[A] equal [V]. But [V] do not [do].But [do] means to be [A].Therefore, [V] is not [A].How is my formula?Is it useful? I think the correct answer is A.Premise: Being articulate has been equated with having a large vocabularyCounter-premise: people with large vocabularies have no incentive for, and tend not to engage in, the kind of creative linguistic self-expression that is required when no available words seem adequateConclusion: a large vocabulary is a hindrance to using language in a truly articulate way.Now what information is required in order the conclusion to be true? In order for the people to be articulate they must have the capacity to express themself. Premise: People with large vocab find it inadequate to use it in making creative expressionConclusion: Large vocab is hindrance for creative expressionAssumption: A --> When people truly have to be articulate in expression, they don't use large vocab and find it inadequate OA is A. Could anyone explain why? Conclusion: Thus a large vocabulary is a hindrance to using language in a truly articulate way.(A) When people are truly articulate, they have the capacity to express themselves in situations in which their vocabularies seem inadequate. [HOLD It](B) People who are able to express themselves creatively in new situations have little incentive to acquire large vocabularies.[Assumption has nothing to do with the incentives – eliminate it](C) The most articulate people are people who have large vocabularies but also are able to express themselves creatively when the situation demands it.[What is the characteristic of the most articulate person is irrelevant – eliminate it](D) In educating people’ to be more articulate, it would be futile to try to increase the size of their vocabularies.[Enticing –conclusion is not about educating , but using of the language – eliminate it](E) In unfamiliar situations, even people with large Vocabularies often do not have specifically suitable words available.[Unfamiliar situation is irrelevant – eliminate it]One great tool for the assumption problem is negation technique: If negating an assumption invalids the conclusion then the assumption is correct. In our example, let’s negate A.When people are truly articulate, they have the capacity to express themselves in situations in which their vocabularies seem [b]adequate.This makes vocabulary an integral part of the language usage. Now, check the conclusion:Conclusion no longer stands.[/b] Right answer is A.Perhaps one can pre-phase, helping one to understand that the definition of true articulateness is based on the ability to express one's self linguistically in a creative manner when no available words seem adequate. Doing enables us to realize that A is the right answer.Cheers,Der alte Fritz. LegendaddyBeing articulate has been equated with having a large vocabulary.

It fails to have impact on the conclusion whether lack of vocab stops one from being articulate or not.However when I tried negation on this on, was really confused.People who are able to express themselves creatively in new situations have LOTS of incentive to acquire large vocabularies.this seems to falter the conclusion, doesnt it?I chose A because it matches with the assumption drawn (y does not cause x). negation of this also kills the conclusion.may be in the stressed out situation of test, I might end up marking a wrong answer in haste.I wish someone can show a better approach for this one.

I disagree with claim Xiii. here's a premise (that is dubiously relevant to claim X)For example:Some people think that democracy is a system that tolerates dissidence. But they're wrong. After all, democracies don't normally allow you to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater.Assumption/Objection?What does ""yelling 'Fire!' in a crowded theater"" have to do with ""tolerating dissidence""?I think the shortest way to the answer would just be to recognize the missing link of relevancy that would connect the premise ""lacking creative self-expression"" to the conclusion, ""using language in a truly articulate way"".If we just scan the answers for ""truly articulate"", we would only find (A) as a contender.Discussing who is ""most articulate"" as (C) does is not the same as whether one is ""truly articulate"".Discussing how to make one ""more articulate"" is not the same as whether one is ""truly articulate"".And (B) and (E) don't have any link to the conclusion. nightblade354Hi nightblade, sorry to be always bothering you, but although i choose A as the answer, I could not logically grasp it, Can you please help me in understanding the question? I have written below what i could make of the question.CON- Thus a large vocabulary is a hindrance to using language in a truly articulate way.PREMISE- People with large vocabularies have no incentive for, and tend not to engage in, the kind of creative linguistic self-expression that is required when no available words seem adequate.I could make out that the author is certain that no other reason other than ""too much vocabulary"" hinders a person from becoming articulate. Being articulate has been equated with having a large vocabulary. Actually, however, people with large vocabularies have no incentive for, and tend not to engage in, the kind of creative linguistic self-expression that is required when no available words seem adequate. Thus a large vocabulary is a hindrance to using language in a truly articulate way.Which one of the following is an assumption made in the argument?Assumption questionPre-thinkingThe author's reasoning is that since people with large vocabulary don't express themselves in a creative way they cannot be defined as articulate.Falsification scenario: What if being articulate does not mean being able to make creative discourses?Assumption: Being articulate=being able to make creative discoursesPOE:(A)When people are truly articulate, they have the capacity to express themselves in situations in which their vocabularies seem inadequate.In line with pre-thinking(B) People who are able to express themselves creatively in new situations have little incentive to acquire large vocabularies.Irrelevant(C) The most articulate people are people who have large vocabularies but also are able to express themselves creatively when the situation demands it.Irrelevant as MOST makes this choice out of scope(D) In educating people’ to be more articulate, it would be futile to try to increase the size of their vocabularies.Irrelevant(E) In unfamiliar situations, even people with large Vocabularies often do not have specifically suitable words available.Irrelevant Premise:Articulate = Large VocabularyArgument:People with Large Vocabulary cannot creatively express themselves when no available word fits inAssumption:?Conclusion:Vocabulary is a hindrance in using language fluently(A) When people are truly articulate, they have the capacity to express themselves in situations in which their vocabularies seem inadequate.Hold on to this, because it is filling in the blank space. If you read the whole sentence at once, it will make sense. People with large vocab cannot express themselves and so vocab is a hindrance in using language frequently. So obviously, a person is only articulate when can express himself where the words fail.(B) People who are able to express themselves creatively in new situations havelittle incentiveto acquire large vocabularies.We are not talking about any incentive to acquire or not acquire anything.(C) The most articulate people are people who have large vocabularies but also are able to express themselves creativelywhen the situation demands it.This was my correct choice but after re-reading the CR i figured out it's wrong because of the phrase "" when situation demands it"" In the question stem it's written, that an articulate person cannot express himself creatively not when the situation demands it but when the words seem in-adequate.(D) In educating people’ to be more articulate, it would be futile to try toincrease the size of their vocabularies.Nor the premise or the argument and the conclusion talks about or even hints about increasing the size of the vocabulary. In the conclusion it is already stated that a large library is an hindrance to articulate people. This option is opposing it.(E) In unfamiliar situations, even people with large Vocabularies oftendo not have specifically suitable words available.In the argument we are taking about not able to express themselves creatively and and not why they are not able to find suitable words. Isn't A just restatement of argument above???? How A can be assumption then??

This choice says that people buy more conventional popcorn than microwave popcorn. However, our conclusion is that people are willing to pay extra money in order to save some time. Hence, this choice does not weaken the MOTIVE/REASON behind the high cost.b.This choice talks about the REASON behind people paying extra money for microwave popcorn. Not only does microwave popcorn saves time but also it helps people stay healthy. This choice clearly refutes what the argument says is ""little additional convenience""c. This choice talks about packaging and quality. So if the price reflects packaging more than the quality, is that good or bad ? Is that worth paying for ? Is that a ""little added convenience"" ? We don't know. Hence, this choice is not affecting the conclusion.d. Okay so you get equal number of unpopped kernel in both the cases. This choice is essentially providing a level field for both the popcorn types and hence is irrelevant.e. This choice says that the microwave popcorn weighs more because of additional oil. Note that in premise 3, we are comparing both the popcorn at the same weight.

But the conclusion assumes that jogging causes these disorders and human anatomy is not able to withstand it.But the connection could be because of something very different. Perhaps the joggers usually like to jog in the early morning since there are fewer vehicles on the road and waking up early is what causes these disorders.Hence option (A) is an assumption made in the argument.

The argument only says that it was ""not always effective"". That doesn't tell us anything about the success rate. We just know that it was not 100%. Few implies a very low success rate.

The total amount increased because more people got the surgery done. So the increase in number of people offset the decreased cost.Say 10 yrs back 10 people used to get it done and cost was $100. So total cost was $1000.Now the total cost has gone up to 1500 though the surgery cost has gone down to $50. Then it means that 300 people are getting it done. So increase in number of people is offsetting the reduced cost.(D) Huge increases in the nation's health care costs are due primarily to increased demand for surgery for older people.We are not given this. The author talks about increased health care costs due to better technology and then illustrates how using cataract example (which is a surgery usually for older people). He does not say that the increased health care costs are PRIMARILY due to surgery for older people. Cataract is just one example of how better technology is increasing health care costs.(E) Ten years ago, cataract surgery was affordable for more people than it was last year.No. Cataract surgery has become more affordable now than it was.Answer (C)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More .............................

If the overall population has increased, then there would be a corresponding increase in the number of operations. The conclusion that the increase in operation happened because of better technology will be challenged.IncorrectB. The increase in operations happened because of more cases of cataract development and not because of people taking advantage of better technology.IncorrectC. The demographics have changed and more people have progressed to an age in which cataract develops. So the increase in operations has not happened because of people wanting to take advantage of better technology.IncorrectD.

These two factors have caused the number of cataract operations performed to increase greatly, which has, in turn, driven up the total amount spent on cataract surgery.Each of the following, if true, would support a challenge to the author's explanation of the increase in the number of cataract operations EXCEPT:(A) The overall population of the nation has increased from what it was ten years ago(B) Any one individual's chance of developing cataracts is greater than it was ten years ago.(C) The number of older people has increased during the last ten years.(D) Today, health insurance covers cataract surgery for more people than it did ten years ago.(E) People who have had unsuccessful cataract surgery are left with more seriously impaired vision than they had before the surgery.In this argument we have a conclusion that Surgeries have become more successfull and more people start doing operations. And we should find 4 premises that will be contradict this conclusion and premise out of scope:(A) The overall population of the nation has increased from what it was ten years agoTen years ago 10 people did this surgery and in this year 15 people do, but population increase in 10 times, so main reason it's population increase. So reason in increased quantity of people and not in success of new technology.Incorrect(B) Any one individual's chance of developing cataracts is greater than it was ten years ago.Persent of people who doing this surgery still the same, but more people have this disease and consequently more people doing this surgery. So reason in increased quantity of this disease and not in success of new technology.Incorrect(C) The number of older people has increased during the last ten years.The same as A the same percent of people who want to do this surgery, but more older people and quantity increase. So reason in increased quantity of old people and not in success of new technology.Incorrect(D) Today, health insurance covers cataract surgery for more people than it did ten years ago.Ten years ago was more people who want to make surgery but don't have money, today more people have money and do this surgery. So reason is that patients have money on this surgery but not in success of new technology.Incorrect(E) People who have had unsuccessful cataract surgery are left with more seriously impaired vision than they had before the surgery.Out of scope.

Does anyone know the source of this question?Here is my analysis:Sentence #1 --- tuatara on south island dyingSentence #2 --- if they're all one species, the same as the north island ones, then saving the south island tuatara isnot importantSentence #3 --- new research: south island tuatara are their own speciesSentence #4 --- since they are unique species, saving the south island tuataraisimportantVery interesting --- with the change in species classification, saving the south island tuatara went from unimportant to important.  That is key for this argument.Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the naturalists’ argumentation?(A) In order to maximize the number of living things on Earth, steps should be taken to preserve all local populations of animals.First of all, does the phrase ""number of living things on Earth"" refer to number of species or number of individual living entities?  Biologist do try to save species that are going extinct, but I don't think anyone is trying to maximize the total number of individual living things.  That's crazy.  I believe scientist don't even know the total number of species on earth: they can estimate it, but the value of that number is somewhat unrelated to their main task.  Savings species is not a numbers game: biologists regard each species as something valuable in and of itself: no one has the idea that, somewhere out there, we are keeping notches for each species on Earth.  More to the point, if we were trying to maximize number of living things, then we would be trying to save the south island tuatara, regardless of their species classification: this in no way explains the huge change in prioritization that appears in the argument.  This is not correct.(B) When an animal is in danger of dying, there is an obligation to help save its life, if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals or people.First of all, this is about an individual animal, not a species.  More importantly, if this were true, then there would have been this obligation to save them in the first sentence, even when we thought the north and south islands tuataras were all the same species.  This also doesn't explain at all how the deaths of the south island tuatara went from unimportant to important.  This is not correct.(C) The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation.This is interesting.  Local extinction --- there are tuataras everywhere, and only those on the south island are dying --- no obligation = it is not important to save them.  But, global extinction --- the south island tuataras are the only example in the world of that particular species ----- obligation = itisimportant to save them.  This very cogently follows and explains the shift in the argument.  This is a promising choice.(D) Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed.This is a distractor.  The south island tuataras are dying because of their natural predators.  The argument says zilch about human activity having an impact on the south island tuataras.  Yes, it is true that human activity often is a culprit in species extinction, so that's a common assumption to make.  Nevertheless, it's not mentioned at all in this particular passage, so there's no support for this answer.  This is incorrect.(E) Species that are found in only one circumscribed geographical region ought to be given more care and attention than are other species because they are more vulnerable to extinction.A wild claim, totally unsupported by the passage.  All over the world, there are species that happen to exist ""in only one circumscribed geographical region"" --- they arenotall teetering on the verge of extinction.  Every species that is found ""in only one circumscribed geographical region"" --- we are easily talking about millions of plants, animals, bacteria, protists, etc. etc.  We can't make a sweeping generalization about all of them, especially one so extreme as saying they are all ""vulnerable to extinction.""  Tell that to the specialized bacterial species that are found only in the Ganges River and that absolutely thrive there!  This answer choice a completely over-the-top claim.  This is incorrect.Thus, we can easily eliminate four answers, and we are left with only one.  (C) makes a distinction that precisely mirrors the distinction made in the argument, so it powerfully supports it.  (C) is the OA.Does all this make sense?Mike_________________Mike McGarryMagoosh Test PrepEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)Signature Read More IMO Cbecause the argument says Tuatara reptiles were supposed to be approaching extinction on the South Island, but were not endangered on North Island, naturalist felt no need to protect them.But, when he got to know that the ones approaching extinction are a distinct species, the naturalist advised that the south island species should be protected at all cost even if it means killing many of their unendangered natural predators.Option C states exactly the same stuff and thus justifies naturalists’ argument... noboruNaturalist: For decades we have known that the tuatara, a New Zealand reptile, has been approaching extinction on the South Island.

Steps should be taken to preserve all local populations of animals.The naturalist is not concerned about ""maximizing number of living things"" because he is suggesting killing predators (which are living things).(B) When an animal is in danger of dying, there is an obligation to help save its life, if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals or people.This is not it. The naturalist is willing to kill other animals so "" if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals"" is not his guiding principle.(C) The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation.This is correct. Till the species was supposed to survive in North (local extinction in South), there was no problem. But when the naturalist realized that the extinction from South would lead to Global extinction, it imposed an obligation to prevent the extinction.(D) Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed.This is not mentioned anywhere. Human activity is irrelevant to this argument.(E) Species that are found in only one circumscribed geographical region ought to be given more care and attention than are other species because they are more vulnerable to extinction.Not given. It might be true that species found in one region are more vulnerable to extinction but naturalist's actions are not based on the principle that they need to be given ""more care and attention"" generally. Only because the species is nearing extinction, the naturalist is worried about saving it.Answer (C)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More souvik101990Naturalist: For decades we have known that the tuatara, a New Zealand reptile, has been approaching extinction on the South Island but since South Island tuatara were thought to be of the same species as North Island tuatara there was no need to protect them.

Steps should be taken to preserve all local populations of animals.- Then why are we open to the idea of killing the predators of Southern Tuatara, which are not close to extinction. Remember we are talking about number of living things and not number of species.(B) When an animal is in danger of dying, there is an obligation to help save its life, if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals or people.- We are open to the idea of killing the predators of Southern Tuatara. This is not ture.(C) The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation.- This is true. The Southerm Tuatara's dwindling numbers didnot create an alarm till the time it was identified as a species that was like the Northern Tuatara, which were plenty in numbers - This indicates that there is no obligation to prevent local extinction.The time it was discovered to be a distinct species from Northern Tuatara, people realised that a unique species is close to extinction - This indicates a threat of global extinction. Hence the people felt obligated to prevent their extinction(D) Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed.- We dont know for sure if human activities were the reason for driving the Southern Tuatara close to extinction. From the stem it seems more likely that it was natural predation by other animals(E) Species that are found in only one circumscribed geographical region ought to be given more care and attention than are other species because they are more vulnerable to extinction.- The stem proposes the idea of killing even those unendangered natural predators of the Southern Tuatara. This implies that even unique local natural predators of Southern Tuantara who are not endangered will be killed. Incorrect. Naturalist: For decades we have known that the tuatara, a New Zealand reptile, have been approaching extinction on the South Island. But since South Island tuatara were thought to be of the same species as North Island tuatara there was no need to protect them.- Implies Local Extinction did not raise any alarmBut new research indicates that the South Island tuatara are a distinct species, found only in that location.

After this study, some obligations to prevent them started.It means when we thought it is a local impact, we didn't do anything. But when we came to know that it is a global impact, we got alert.This is what option C is doing.(A) In order to maximize the number of living things on Earth, steps should be taken to preserve all local populations of animals. :OFS. All local is not relevant. Not matching with what we need.(B) When an animal is in danger of dying, there is an obligation to help save its life, if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals or people.: But we are interfering with the health of other species as per the argument, Hence, this option is incorrect.(C) The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation.Correct for the reasons mentioned above.(D) Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed.: ok, I will do so. But how does it relate to what we want?.(E) Species that are found in only one circumscribed geographical region ought to be given more care and attention than are other species because they are more vulnerable to extinction.We are talking about endangered species only.

Irreevant.Incorrect.Answer: B Picked the correct answer (B) but couldn't E be correct as well?(E) Among children not infected with the virus, fewer than 30 percent develop middle ear infections.Which means that even children not infected by the virus can develop middle ear infections.

Antibiotics, although effective in treating bacterial infections, have no effect on the virus. Yet when middle ear infections in children infected with the virus are treated with antibiotics, the ear infections often clear up.Which one of the following most helps to explain the success of the treatments with antibiotics?(A) Although some types of antibiotics fail to clear up certain infections, other types of antibiotics might provide effective treatment for those infections.(B) Children infected with the virus are particularly susceptible to bacteria that infect the middle ear.(C) Many children who develop middle ear infections are not infected with the virus.(D) Most viral infections are more difficult to treat than are most bacterial infections.(E) Among children not infected with the virus, fewer than 30 percent develop middle ear infections.The link ideas in passage are:(1) Virus caused an infection in children => 30% of children had middle ear infections.(2) The antibiotics treat bacterial only and have no effect on virus.(3) However, the antibiotics treat middle ear infections in (1) well.The correct answer is the one sets a connection between these facts.(A) Although some types of antibiotics fail to clear up certain infections, other types of antibiotics might provide effective treatment for those infections.Irrelevant as opposed to (2)(B) Children infected with the virus are particularly susceptible to bacteria that infect the middle ear.Correct.

Inez is presupposing the truth of one of the following answer choices in her argument, according to the question stem.  Well, her argument states that you should judge a country by the morality of its actions.  This presupposes that there is some way to gauge the ""morality"" of a country's actions.  C hits this mark.  If you cannot assign moral weight to the actions of countries, then there is no way to judge a country by the morality of its actions. ) At least one country is admirable -irrelevant , no such example is given(B) Countries cannot be both strong and moral -not necessary , according to second person , country needs to be moral , it could be strong as well , but it must be moral.(C) It is possible to assign moral weight to the actions of countries -yes , negate this and it will break second persons statement. If you cant assign moral weight to actions , then how you will decide the country is moral or not ? so hence this is assumption.(D) The citizens of any country does is good -irrelevant(E) Countries should impose their standards of morality on other countries by whatever means necessary  -we are not discussing about imposing morality.

Inez must assume this in order to make his/her claim. Furthermore, if you negate this assumption, Inez's argument falls apart.(D) The citizens of any country does is goodIncorrect-  What is this even saying? Regardless, it discusses the actions of individuals within the country, not the country itself.(E) Countries should impose their standards of morality on other countries by whatever means necessaryIncorrect- This does not need to be assumed for Inez to make his/her claim.

They will remain morally corrupt.He says there are many examples (which means not all the examples)  in history...meaninThis means that he doesnt believe that all the strong counties are immoral. Hence, b is incorrect. I think B can be right because of this statement, ""We should judge a country by the morality of its actions, not by its strength.  "" That means Inez meant that,  even if we judge a country by its strength, the judgement comes out to be wrong. Because countries with strength aren't perceived to be respectable and admiring. balaji4799I think B can be right because of this statement, ""We should judge a country by the morality of its actions, not by its strength.

The points known to us are:Approximate date for when a warmer climate developed can be taken out by dating Fossils of pollen and beetles. Beetle fossils show that warm climate developed immediately after melting of the glacier. Pollen fossils show that warm climates developed after a relatively longer time.Now let's look at the options to understand -A)Cold-weather beetle fossils can be mistaken for those of beetles that live in warm climates.- Yes, this explains the discrepancy in results. The beetle taken into consideration might be a beetle from a warmer climate, which would suggest that the warm climate developed immediately.B)Warm-weather plants cannot establish themselves as quickly as can beetles in a new environment.- If warm weathers do not establish themselves quickly enough, it might seem that the warm climate happened sometime after the glacier melted.C)Beetles can survive in a relatively barren postglacial area by scavenging.- I find this to be a trap option. But, if beetles scavenge, its might seem that the warmer climate developed immediately after the glacier melted; whereas the beetle might have scavenged and survived for a longer time.D)Since planes spread unevenly in a new climate, researchers can mistake gaps in the pollen record as evidence of no new overall growth.- Explains why researchers could have mistaken the gaps and caused a discrepancy.Now we're left with only E.

Choose an option that DOES NOT explain it.(A) Cold-weather beetle fossils can be mistaken for those of beetles that live in warm climates.This explains. Beetle record could be that of cold weather beetles and hence could have been found much sooner.(B) Warm-weather plants cannot establish themselves as quickly as can beetles in a new environment.Explains. Beetles come back much more quickly and establish themselves. Warm weather plants could take much longer.(C) Beetles can survive in a relatively barren postglacial area by scavenging.Explains. Beetles can survive in barren lands so they could have established themselves much before plants.(D) Since plants spread unevenly in a new climate, researchers can mistake gaps in the pollen record as evidence of no new overall growth.Plants spread unevenly in a new climate (they could grow slowly for a while and then spread rapidly later and then slowly again for a while or they could grow in only one small area for a while and later spread etc) so there could be gaps in pollen record. This could explain why no pollen record may have been found even though there may have been plant growth much earlier.(E) Beetles are among the oldest insect species and are much older than many warm-weather plants.Irrelevant. When beetles and warm weather plants evolved initially is irrelevant. We are talking about when they re-populated melted glacier areas.Answer (E)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More The statement that does not help explain the apparent discrepancy between the insect and pollen records is (E) Beetles are among the oldest insect species and are much older than many warm-weather plants.The reason why (E) does not explain the discrepancy is that the age of beetles compared to warm-weather plants does not provide any information about the timing of the development of a warmer climate. The age of a species does not necessarily correlate with the timing of climate change or the establishment of a warm climate. Therefore, this statement does not address the issue of why the insect record indicates an immediate warm climate while the pollen record suggests a delayed development of a warm climate. Answer choices call for far too many assumptions. E should be as good of an explanation for the discrepancy as any other choice. By suggesting that beetles are far older than warm weather plants, there is a valid scenario posited that this particular glacial area may have melted far enough back in the past that warm weather plants simply didn't develop and thus the pollen record wouldn't count for anything.Answer choice C at the very least, is as viable a candidate as E. But mostly, I am not really convinced by any of these choices; all of them under various scenarios can serve as viable explanations for the discrepancy. Ritik25I'd be very wary of questioning an official LSAT problem. These things get very well-reviewed, and we have a an objection, it's rarely the problem that is wrong!In this case, we can't assume from E that because beetles are older than other insects and MANY warm-weather plants, then warm-weather beetles existed before ANY warm-weather plants we'd be looking at. E really tells us nothing about the development of the beetles and plants described in the premises, so it does nothing at all to resolve the discrepancy. (And to get real-world for a minute, if we look back at history, we're not going to see a period of warm weather in which ANIMALS existed but NO PLANTS existed. That simply isn't possible.)_________________Dmitry Farber | Manhattan Prep GMAT Instructor | San DiegoManhattan GMAT Discount|Manhattan GMAT Course Reviews|View Instructor ProfileSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

J. Thomson were creative researchers before studying under him, then clearly the argument would be specious. On the other hand, if none of the physicists were creative researchers before studying under Thomson, then the argument would be strong. However, the argument does not require this strong of a statement in order to be valid. All it needs is one person whose research skills profited from the tutelage of Thomson.The answer is (C).Many students have problems with this type of question. They read through the answer-choices and find no significant statements. They may pause at (C) but reject it—thinking that the argument would be deceptive if only one person out of 122 profited from the tutelage of Thomson. However, the missing premise doesn’t have to make the argument good, just valid._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalNew!MBA Spotlight Fair -  meet (almost) Top 25 MBA Programs in ONE eventSignature Read More I had difficulty understanding (C) because of the double negatives.

They could spend their own money to get elected so that they could make much more.(B) Most Valitanian elective offices have four-year terms.Irrelevant.(C) No more people compete for elected office when officeholders are paid well then when they are paid poorly.Our focus is on the type of people who compete for elected office, not number of people. We could assume that the people who want to serve the nation will compete no matter how they are paid and when paid well, the greedy ones would be additional and hence, if the same number of people compete then it means that only the loyals are competing - but all this is a lot of assumption. Let's see if we have a more direct answer.(D) Only politicians who rely on their offices for income tend to support policies that advance their own selfish interests.Does not weaken our conclusion. We don't know how many politicians rely on their office income and hence advance their own selfish interests. If a large majority of officeholders rely on their office income, they would be furthering their own interest and hence there would be wrong kind of people in politics.(E) Most of those who are currently Valitanian politicians could have obtained better-paid work outside politics.This tells you that most politicians could have obtained an even higher salary outside. This means that they are in politics not for their salaries but for something else.

Aristole's got some great stuff..and great tips for beginning one's GMAT journey..but this is a horrible horrible question.What's the CONCLUSION here?- Freedom of speech is the ONLY rational policy?- Government should adopt rational policies thus Freedom of Speech?Both of the cases above, the key word is *rational* and the argument goes on to explain why why Freedom of Speech is rational/good.This means to strengthen the argument we are looking for anything that can fill the gaps:- Mitigate Freedom of speech's bad sides- Why government shouldn't adopt irrational policies- Why this government shouldn't adopt other rational policies- Government should only adopt policies that are basic human rights..(D) Governments are less likely to be overthrown if they openly adopt a policy allowing freedom of speechThe correct answer talks about overthrown..which is not at all discussed in the argument nor is it an issue that can be inferred. I would actually argue that rational vs. stay in office are actually slightly contrasting goals. We have see this all too often from history, the most hipster, most hope-seeking, the most people-pleasing policy are always adopted first to secure a position in office. Are any of these in the rational category? ........Very rarely. My take :Conc : it is also the only rational policy for this government to adoptWhy ? : Some advantages ....(A) Most citizens would tolerate some limits on freedom of speech --> limiting is out of scope(B) With or without a policy of freedom of speech, governments respond to dangerous ideas irrationally -->2 issues that i find here, A, with or without, --> this implies freedom of speech has no effect, 2. the scope of the argument is too narrow,we also have other benefits of FOS what about them ?(C) Freedom of religion and freedom of assembly are also basic human rights than governments must recognize --> argument is not really concerned with freedom of religion and assembly.(D) Governments are less likely to be overthrown if they openly adopt a policy allowing freedom of speech --> Looks good, gives a motive for the govt to accept the policy.(E) Great ideas have flourished in societies that repress free speech as often as in those that permit it --> this negates somewhat. Good question.

Premise 1 needs to be ignored, because conditionality of conclusion mentions that identity will be revealed even if the info. is true.(A) The information that the informant provided is known to be false.Does't connect to the conclusion, which mentions reveal ''even if the info is true.(B) The journalist's editor will not order her to reveal the informant's identity unless the information is accurate and concerns public safety.~ information accurate and concerns public safety ---> ~ order her to reveal.Contra positive: order her to reveal ---> information accurate and concerns public safetythis seems to against the argument(C) If the information concerns safety at the power plant, a judge will order the journalist to reveal her informant's identity.This connects the Premise 2 & conclusion well:info. safety at the power plant ---> Judge order ---> reveal info(D) The truth of the information provided by the informant can be verified only if the informant's identity is publicly revealed.verification of truth has nothing to do with the argument(E) The informant understood, at the time the journalist promised him confidentiality, that she would break this promise if ordered to do so by a judge.Just a restatement of premise 2, gives us nothing about the conclusion.Also, if an argument says:~ info false ---> prosecutedcan i read it as: True ---> prosecuted?Is it advisable to reverse the logical statements this way? I read somewhere that we shouldn't.ThanksASHUTOSH Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

This is the paradox we need to resolve.RESOLVING THE PARADOXSecond line of reasoning1.	It is possible that the regions dominated by the city did not have the water resources at hand that were required for making use of waterpower.2.

It just lets us know that Romans had prowess but doesn't resolves why the difference. If anything it only adds to paradox to remain so as is inferred from this choice.(B) In the areas in which water power was not used water flow in rivers and streams was substantial throughout the year but nevertheless exhibited some seasonal variation. - WRONG. It does the same job as A does but only with slight lesser degree in intensity. Assuming things leads to either of the direction - resolving or not resolving. Thus, not a good candidate.(C) Water power was relatively vulnerable to sabotage but any damage could be quickly and inexpensively repaired. - WRONG. Irrelevant.

Well, it's hard to say. Does substantial water flow mean it's a good source of power? Or is too much flow a bad thing? And how much seasonal variation in flow is acceptable? Is ""some"" seasonal variation a bad thing? Or does the variation need to be really big to have an effect?While these are interesting questions, the passage doesn't give us any information on which to answer them. For that reason, we can't say really say how (B) affects the passage, and we can discard it.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

This maker her enjoy a good novel more.Lee's second novel is set in SF and in this novel too, as in his first, he passes the reviewer's test - i.e. he knows the city in which the tale is set as well as the reviewer.(A) The book reviewer enjoys virtually any novel written by a novelist whom she trustsNo. If she trusts the author, she trusts the tale which increases her enjoyment of a GOOD tale. If the tale is not good, she may not like it - we don't know.(B) If the book reviewer trusts the novelist as a storyteller, the novel in question must be set in a city the book reviewer knows wellThe argument doesn't tell us what she does in case she herself doesn't know the city. So we cannot infer this.(C) Peter Lee's first novel was set in San FranciscoNot given in the argument.(D) The book reviewer does not trust any novel set in a city that she does not know wellAgain, the argument doesn't tell us what she does in case she herself doesn't know the city. So we cannot infer this.(E) The book reviewer does not believe that she knows San Francisco better than Peter Lee doesSince Lee passes the test with flying colors, it means he knows SF as well as the reviewer. So the reviewer does not believe that she knows SF better than Lee. This is correct. We can infer this.Answer (E)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More HiLet us try to understand the argument first:LetA = Book reviewer knows the city wellB = novel shows that the story teller knows the city as much as the Book reviewer does.CASE 1:If A AND B-> take the story teller seriously -> trust the story teller & trust the tale -> increase enjoyment level of a good novelCASE 2:If A AND NOT B -> do not trust the story tellerThe book reviewer uses the above to test story tellers. It should be noted that the test does not address anything about scenarios where the book reviewer does not know a city well.Lets analyze the last statement:Peter Lee's second novel is set in San Francisco, in this novel, as in his first, Lee passes my test with flying colours.This means that Peter Lee wrote 2 novels. The second book is set in San Francisco. Lee passes the book reviewer's test in both first and second book.This means:Book 2: Set in San Francisco. Passes book reviewer's test (i.e. CASE 1). Therefore, the book reviewer knows San Francisco. The story teller knows San Francisco as much as the Book reviewer does.Book 1: Set in some city. Passes book reviewer's test (i.e. CASE 1). Therefore, the book reviewer knows the city. The story teller knows the city as much as the Book reviewer does.With this understanding, let us evaluate the options:(A) The book reviewer enjoys virtually any novel written by a novelist whom she trustsThe book reviewer says ""This trust increases my enjoyment of a good novel"".1. ""this trust"" talks about the particular trust that is gained when the story teller demonstrates that he knows the city as much as the book reviewer does.2. ""good novel"" implies that the above trust -> increase enjoyment level when the novel is good. The statement does not address the scenario where the book reviewer does not consider a novel as good.So cant infer Option A(B) If the book reviewer trusts the novelist as a storyteller, the novel in question must be set in a city the book reviewer knows well.The option confuses necessary & sufficient conditions. The book reviewer says ""When a novelist demonstrates the required knowledge, I trust the story teller"". It does not say thatOnlywhen the novelist demonstrates the knowledge does he trust the story teller.If X-> Y, we cant say that if Y occurs then X must have occured unless there is no other factor Z-> Y(C) Peter Lee's first novel was set in San FranciscoWrong interpretation. Book reviewer knew the city but that does not mean that it has to be San Francisco.(D) The book reviewer does not trust any novel set in a city that she does not know wellCannot be inferred.If X-> Y, we cant say that if X has not occurred Y will not occur since some other factor Z -> Y(E) The book reviewer does not believe that she knows San Francisco better than Peter Lee doesCorrect answer. Peter's second novel that is set in San Francisco passes the book reviewer's test (i.e. CASE 1 - A AND B). Therefore B has occurred i.e. The story teller knows the city as much as the book reviewer does. Therefore, the book reviewer does not believe that she knows San Francisco better than Peter does. Solved it in less than a minute.If you read between lines, Options A, B and D are extreme options.Look for the words 'ONLY', 'ANY' etc.Generally, the extreme statements are not correct in GMAT.Option C is picked from the argument. (remember it's an inference question).Hence, option E is correct.

Please help me to correct what ugly mistake I am doing.Please suggestVeritasKarishmaAndrewNsirYes,imSKR, I can see that you are confused. You singled out the correct line from the passage to support (E). If the writer knows the city in questionas well asthe reviewer, then they areequalin their knowledge of that city, so it is appropriate to say that the reviewerdoes not believe that she knows San Franciscobetterthan Peter Lee does. Note that if you sawat leastahead ofas well asin the passage, such language would imply that the author might knowmorethan the reviewer. Either way, though, choice (E) would hold.Regarding choice (B), once again, you singled out the correct line of the passage. You may have overlooked the first word, however:when. This helps us understand that the reviewer is commenting on only one type of work that she reads. The rest of the information in the passage relates to this subset of novels, but we cannot say thatjust becausethe reviewer trusts the novelist as a storyteller, she, the reviewer, must be reading a novel set in a familiar city. The reviewer might be reading some other type of novel for which we have no established criteria in the passage. Perhaps she can enjoy a fantasy tale, for instance, without adhering to the same rigid set of conditions she would apply to the type of novel in question.I hope that helps. My advice? Stick to the surface of what the passage says. When you start getting twisted up in could-be-true conditions, you will find yourself in real trouble on these LSAT questions. (I said something similar inthis recent responseto another LSAT question.)Happy reading, and good luck with your studies.- Andrew_________________I am no longer contributing to GMAT Club.

If it is not set in city she knows , we can not infer. Option B only talks within scope, so why no B.I know I am wrong somewhere. Please help me to correct what ugly mistake I am doing.Please suggestVeritasKarishmaAndrewNsirYes,imSKR, I can see that you are confused. You singled out the correct line from the passage to support (E). If the writer knows the city in questionas well asthe reviewer, then they areequalin their knowledge of that city, so it is appropriate to say that the reviewerdoes not believe that she knows San Franciscobetterthan Peter Lee does. Note that if you sawat leastahead ofas well asin the passage, such language would imply that the author might knowmorethan the reviewer. Either way, though, choice (E) would hold.Regarding choice (B), once again, you singled out the correct line of the passage. You may have overlooked the first word, however:when. This helps us understand that the reviewer is commenting on only one type of work that she reads. The rest of the information in the passage relates to this subset of novels, but we cannot say thatjust becausethe reviewer trusts the novelist as a storyteller, she, the reviewer, must be reading a novel set in a familiar city. The reviewer might be reading some other type of novel for which we have no established criteria in the passage. Perhaps she can enjoy a fantasy tale, for instance, without adhering to the same rigid set of conditions she would apply to the type of novel in question.I hope that helps. My advice? Stick to the surface of what the passage says. When you start getting twisted up in could-be-true conditions, you will find yourself in real trouble on these LSAT questions. (I said something similar inthis recent responseto another LSAT question.)Happy reading, and good luck with your studies.- AndrewI read your tips several times today. I realized my mistakes . After applying your tip, the question seemed very easy . It was just a matter of key words to differentiate between B and E.I will not over generalized any more ( hope so my mind supports the same).Thanks for highlighting the mistake I was doing( now that mistake seems silly as  someone asks to pick a thing from top of table and i can not see there.)

Nverma does a nice job attacking the stimulus and directing your brain to the right answer.  I'll just have fun explaining why each wrong answer is wrong.A.  The conclusion of the stimulus deals with offering those with the most highly evaluated auditions, scholarships.  What the applicants do after the committee's offer is beyond the scope.  Remember, this is a weaken question.  This does not attack the conclusion - that the method the committee is employing will ensure the top 10% of each group will receive scholarship offers.  What if the committee DID make offers to the top 10% of each?  This seems to fail at weakening the argument.B.  The method of assessment is outside the scope of the argument.  But let's run with this idea.  So, person A comes in.  Person A brought with them a lion from the Savannah.  The lion fakes eating person A, the whole act blows the judges away, person A exits the stage and is lauded by the judges.  Then person B comes up to be evaluated.  Person B has a pet mouse.  Person B finds it brilliant to use the mouse in his/her routine.  The judges aren't thrilled.  They went from a lion almost eating someone, to a mouse doing next to nothing.  BUT WHO CARES?  The conclusion states that the top 10% of each group are OFFERED scholarships.  Person B jaded in comparison to Person A.  You could probably make the argument that the magnificence of A negatively affected B.  But again, who cares?  B could have sucked regardless of A - so B shouldn't be offered a scholarship anyway.  This is perfectly plausible with the conclusion.  Hence, it does NOT weaken.C.  The need of the scholarships is outside of the scope.  Curse the LSAT gods for wasting seconds of your life, then move on.D.  nverma explains why this is true.  think about relativity.  500 in group a.  100 in group b.10% of 500 = 5010% of 100 = 10However, applications in group A from 400-449 scored 97% on their applications.In group B - the 10/100 applications scored -- 3, 99%s ;  4 98%s ;  but 3, 92%sSeems to me that those in group a from 400-449 got SCREWED!E.  This is tricky, however outside of the scope.  Even though the non locals may be favored, this doesn't necessarily preclude the offering of scholarships to the most highly evaluated candidates. IMO ANSWER SHOULD BE ""D""......WE ARE SELECTING 10% BEST APPLICANTS FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THEN ASSUMING WE HAVE SELECTED THE BEST OUT OF THE AMALGAMATED  JOINT GROUP.....WHICH IS WRONG....POINTS TO FLAW........THE 10% IN EACH GROUP MAY BE THE BEST IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS BUT SOME MAY NOT BE THE BEST AMONGST THE WHOLE LOT...ASSUME ONE GROUP WITH ALL TALENT AND ANOTHER WITH ALL DUDS..........EVEN THE BEST OF THE DUD LOT CANNOT BEAT THE 11TH OF THE OTHER LOT.......HENCE ""D"" WHICH SAYS-----Some of the applicants who are offered scholarships could have less highly evaluated auditions than some of the applicants who are not offered scholarships.....BRINGS OUT THE FLAW.....HENCE CORRECT ANSWER.... Which one of the following points out why the trustees' plan might not be effective in achieving its goalWhat is goal : Give scholarships to highly evaluated applicants (If they don't want to take it, it will be their problem not trustee's)Option D correctly states that, because of local and non-local grouping there might be a chance that some of the scholarship baggers will be less evaluated.Let's see an Example :Local Got : (100,90,80,70,60,50..,10) PointsNon Local got : (10,9,8,7,6,5..,1) PointsIn this case it will be unfair for 90% local as None of non local is highly evaluated than local.IMO 'D' is correct. The trustees of the Avonbridge summer drama workshop have decided to offer scholarships to the top 10 percent of local applicants and the top 10 percent of nonlocal applicants as judged on the basis of a qualifying audition. They are doing this to ensure that only the applicants with the most highly evaluated auditions are offered scholarships to the program.They want to give scholarship to both Local and Non-Local applicants. They want to give scholarships to the most highly evaluated auditions.Which one of the following points out why the trustees' plan might not be effective in achieving its goal?(A) The best actors can also apply for admission to another program and then not enroll in the Avonbridge program -Thats okay but their plan of giving to only highly evaluated auditions are still maintained.(B) Audition materials that produce good results for one actor may disadvantage another, resulting in inaccurate assessment -If that is the case, then actor would not be highly evaluated who performed bad.(C) The top 10 percent of local and nonlocal applicants might not need scholarships to the Avonbridge program -Thats okay but we are still offering to highly evaluated people.(D) Some of the applicants who are offered scholarships could have less highly evaluated auditions than some of the applicants who are not offered scholarships -This could be true in the case if we have two different groups of talent pool we want to judge on. Then, we would not offer based on high evaluation criteria.(E) Dividing applicants into local and nonlocal groups is unfair because it favors nonlocal applicants -But still we cant say that it is affecting the plan trustees have in mind.Correct Answer D Difference between (B) and (D)? lakshya14Difference between (B) and (D)?Hello,lakshya14. The difference I see between the two answer choices is that (B) focuses on thematerialsused during the auditions, and that is an independent variable that does not in any way tie intothe trustees' plan. The goal of that plan, as outlined in the passage, isto ensure that only the applicants with the most highly evaluated auditions are offered scholarships to the program. In order to weaken that plan, then, we need to find an answer that focuses on the evaluations themselves, not on the audition materials. Choice (D) is exactly what we are looking for:Quote:(D) Some of the applicants who are offered scholarshipscould have less highly evaluated auditionsthan some of the applicants who are not offered scholarshipsBecause the plan adopts a top 10 percent local/nonlocal split, it could be true that, say, many more qualified (higher-scoring) nonlocal applicants from a pool of 100,000 students might not receive scholarships when applicants from a smaller local pool of maybe 10,000 students might be offered them. We have no numbers to lean on in the passage, but our little scenario here shows that (D) attacks the plan itself, just what we are looking to do.I hope that helps.

This is what D points out.In B, it's possible that good results for one actor may disadvantage another, but isn't that is what is expected out of auditions i.e. the better one is selected.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

No key words both in the argument and in the question indicate where the conclusion is.My question is how to deal with such kind of question?If you aren't sure about the conclusion, ask yourself, ""Why is this passage here? What is the author trying to do?"" Is the author's main point that ""the troubles of Western civilization began with the invention of money"" or that imitation money is worse than real money? As a test, try putting the word ""therefore"" in front of the part you believe to be the conclusion. Does the rest of the passage form an argument supporting that conclusion?Does the author tell us that ""the use of money causes a civilization to decline"" as evidence to support that ""the decline of Western civilization exactly parallels the increasing use of money as a substitute for things of intrinsic value""? No, in fact, it is the opposite. Everything in the passage after the first sentence forms an argument that logically leads to the conclusion that, ""[therefore], the use of money causes a civilization to decline."" The phrase, ""that this is true is shown by..."" is a hint that the previous sentence was your conclusion. The author starts with a statement and then explicitly says that what follows will support that first statement.Once you've arrived at the conclusion or purpose of a passage, make sure you understand how the author arrives at that conclusion or purpose:""the troubles of Western civilization began with the invention of money"" - If this is true, it would be evidencesupporting(not proving) the author's conclusion.""The decline of Western civilization exactly parallels the increasing use of money—both real money and worthless paper money—as a substitute for things of intrinsic value."" - Okay, if the decline of Western civilization exactly parallels the increasing use of money, then, again, this would be evidence supporting the author's conclusion. But why is money bad for a civilization? We aren't told why specifically, but we can infer that using money as a substitute for things of intrinsic value is bad for a civilization.""While real money (gold and silver) is bad enough, imitation money (paper money) is a horror."" - This statement supports the inference that using money as a substitute for things of intrinsic value is bad for civilization. In other words, ""real"" money (gold and silver) is bad enough because it is a substitute for things of intrinsic value. ""Imitation"" money is even worse because it is a substitute for ""real"" money (a substitute for a substitute!).I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More The use of money causes a civilization to decline.That this is true is shown by the way the troubles ofWestern civilization began with the invention ofmoney.

If the question had said ""The use of money has caused thewestern civilisationto decline"", then whatever has happened with the eastern civilisation wouldn't have been our concern. But the question generalises the statement by saying the use of money causesa civilisationto decline. He then goes on to justify this statement by giving the example of the western civilisation, but his main conclusion is a generalisation of what happens with civilisations in general. Hence, it is appropriate to consider other civilisations.Hope this helps! CEdwardSo B) seems to me to use evidence from a different place to weaken the argument. This is not typically allowed on the GMAT, but it is here?HiCEdwardthe argument conclusion is that the use of money causes the civilization to decline, and the argument then goes on to support this by citing an example of western civilization. While B provides a contrary point of view that ""hey eastern civilizations also used money, but they didn't decline/collapse"". Now this undermines the author's claim directly.What has helped me personally with strengthen/weaken questions is to personalize the argument i.e. what/how would I respond to the author in the scenario and whether there would be a comeback from the author to my line of reasoning.

Hence, this answer fits the  required assumption.(B) The higher rate of serious head injury suffered by victims of horseback-riding accidents is due to the difference in size between horses and motorcycles.This answer is out of scope since nothing is mentioned about it in the paragraph.(C) The medical costs associated with treating head injuries are higher than those for other types of injury..This answer is out of scope as we are not comparing the medical cost of treating head injuries with other type of injuries.(D) Most fatalities resulting from horseback-riding and motorcycle accidents could have been prevented if the victims had been wearing helmets.Well the paragraph does not mention anything about fatalities but only about serious head injuries. Hence, this is an out of scope answer choice.(E) When deciding whether to enact helmet laws for motorcyclists and horseback riders, the jurisdiction's primary concerns is the safety of its citizens.I doubt if this answer choice is correct because in the complete paragraph, some focus has also been made on reducing cost to tax payers.

Is there an explanation for each answer choice?This question asks:Quote:Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the author's conclusionconcerning helmets for horseback ridersdepends?Let's revisit the argument and break it all down!Quote:Head injury is the most serious type of injury sustained in motorcycle accidents. The average cost to taxpayers for medical care for nonhelmeted motorcycle-accident victims is twice that for their helmeted counterparts. Jurisdictions that have enacted motorcycle-helmet laws have reduced the incidence and severity of accident-related head injuries, thereby reducing the cost to taxpayers. Therefore, to achieve similar cost reductions, other jurisdictions should enact motorcycle-helmet laws. For the same reason jurisdictions should also require helmets for horseback riders, since horseback-riding accidents are even more likely to cause serious head injury than motorcycle accidents are.The argument has two conclusions:1. Jurisdictions should require helmets for motorcyclists, in order to achieve cost reductions.2. Jurisdictions should require helmets for horseback riders, for the same reason it requires helmets for motorcyclists (to achieve cost reductions).We're only asked about conclusion #2, but let's walk through the logic of the entire argument:The average cost of medical care for non-helmeted motorcycle-accident victims is 2x that of care for helmeted victims.Jurisdictions that have required motorcycle helmets have reduced the incidence and severity of accident-related head injuries.Reducing the incidence and severity of accident-related head injuries has resulted inreduced costto taxpayers.Therefore,to achieve cost reductions, other jurisdictions should also require motorcyclists to wear helmets.Horse-back riding accidents are even more likely to cause serious head injuries than motorcycle accidents are.Therefore,to achieve cost reductions, jurisdictions should also requirehorseback ridersto wear helmets.We have a very clear chain of logic to justify the author's first conclusion. Caring for non-helmeted motorcycle accident victims is expensive. When jurisdictions require motorcycle helmets, we see the incidence and severity of accident-related head injuries fall. We also see the associated costs fall. Therefore, enacting motorcycle helmet laws in other jurisdictions should result in similar cost reductions in those jurisdictions.The logical leap to requiring helmets for horseback riders doesn't give us that nice, concrete bridge to walk (gallop?) across with the author. Most importantly, we don't have any information about how much horseback riders (helmeted or not) cost taxpayers when their heads are injured. We do know that head injuries suffered during horseback riding accidents are more likely to be severe, but there's not a single word linking that severity to cost.It's incredibly tempting to just replace ""motorcycle"" with ""horseback"" in our brains (definitely true in my daily life). Butnone of these connections are spelled out for horseback riders.So when reviewing the answer choices, we want to keep the one that best fills in the blanks. Let's get to it:Quote:(A) Medical care for victims of horseback-riding accidents is financial drain on tax funds.Bingo! This is a simple,explicitconfirmation that caring for horseback accident victims is costly to taxpayers.The argument is still focused on head injuries, but we can accept that ""medical care"" for these victims refers to care for all kinds of injuries, including head injuries. So we don't need to change our understanding of the argument to keep (A) around. The language is still targeted enough to bridge gaps between being horseback-riding accidents, injury, and cost to taxpayers.Quote:(B) The higher rate of serious head injury suffered by victims of horseback-riding accidents is due to the difference in size between horses and motorcycles.We don't care aboutwhyhorseback accident victims suffer serious head injuries. The argument for motorcycle helmets is made to achieve cost reductions, and the argument for horseback helmets is made ""for the same reason."" (B) doesn't address cost at all, so let's eliminate it.Quote:(C) The medical costs associated with treating head injuries are higher than those for other types of injury.This choice compares the cost of treating head injuriesin generalto the cost of treating other types of injuriesin general. This is extremely broad, and more importantly it's the wrong comparison. We're looking for information that lets us compare the costs of injuries from horseback accidents to the costs of injuries from motorcycle accidents. Knowing that both types of injuries cost more than, say, stubbing your toe, is relatively useless when it comes to filling out the specific argument that we care about.Also keep in mind that (A) is much more concrete in the way it creates the connection between horseback riding injuries and cost. It's a great answer choice. This one? Not so much. So we'll keep (A), eliminate (C), and move on.Quote:(D) Most fatalities resulting from horseback-riding and motorcycle accidents could have been prevented if the victims had been wearing helmets.Neither conclusion depends on this assumption to be valid. The conclusions focus on costs created when motorcycle and horseback riders are injured in accidents, not on the rate of death in these accidents. Eliminate (D).Quote:(E) When deciding whether to enact helmet laws for motorcyclists and horseback riders, the jurisdiction's primary concerns is the safety of its citizens.Both conclusions are explicitly concerned with cost to taxpayers, not the safety of citizens. It may be harsh, but for this reason we eliminate (E).(A) remains the best choice available. I'd ride off into sunset, but I don't have a helmet. (I'm practicing my dad jokes.

No.This is what (C) says: Non existence cannot be established by absence of evidence.You cannot convert the negatives to positives._________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

Waiting eagerly for your valuable inputs. Regards, FameWhat's very hard about this argument is the nature of the conclusion.  We are asked, which ""best counters the argument?"", but the question is, what is the argument?  The main conclusion isnotabout whether trade actually existed between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages.  Rather, the conclusion is about whether an argument is a sound argument.The author is presumably responding to historians who argued --- ""no written record ==> this trade didn't exist.""The author's conclusion is that this, the historian's argument, is a bad argument.The author supports his conclusion by analogy --- by the analogy with an argument about the purported existence of the Yeti. Clearly, in the Yeti's cases, a lack of sightings is not conclusive, but one clear photo of a Yeti would be conclusive proof.We are asked to counter, not the argument by historians, but the author's argument by analogy.

In the case of trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages, there are written records where this trade would have been very likely to have been mentioned if it existed, and it's not mentioned.  In that context, the ""no mention"" is actually very strong evidence against the existence of such trade.  This is a very different scenario than if we just had no written records of any sort ---- if all written records had been lost, then we could reasonably argue, ""maybe the trade existed, was written about, and those written records were lost.""  But, if we have verifiable records that would have been likely to mention the trade, and thesedon'tmention it, then that's a circumstance in which the lack of mention is damning evidence against the existence of this trade.Furthermore, this is precisely where the analogy breaks down.  There are very specific texts of which we can say --- if the trade had existed, it would have been mentioned here.  There's no analogous spot for Yeti-sighting.  Where does the Yeti live?  In the Himalayas, a huge and vastly inaccessible region.  There's no ""prime Yeti spot"", of which we could say --- if a Yeti existed, you would be likely to see it right here in this specific location.This is the one answer that shatters the argument by analogy, which is the core of the author's argument.Does this make sense?Mike_________________Mike McGarryMagoosh Test PrepEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)Signature Read More HIMALAYAArguing that there was no trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages because there are no written records of such trade is like arguing that the Yeti, an apelike creature supposedly existing in the Himalayas, does not exist because there have been no scientifically confirmed sightings.

Butwhat argument you should counter?The author says:""No written records --> No trade"" is NOT correct. He uses a similar example: ""No evidence of Yeti --> Yeti did not exist"" is WRONG, because even no evidence, Yeti actually existed.In short, the author's conclusion is: No written records --> DOES NOT MEAN ""No trade"".You should attack his conclusion by showing that:""No written records --> No trade"" is CORRECT.E says: There are written records that do not mention trade.But if trade actually had existed, the records would have been mentioned.--> It means ""No written records --> No trade"" is CORRECT.Hope it helps.

The answer makes an argument that uses a lack of evidence to prove/disprove something. Remember, take the answers as if true. E lays out an argument that uses lack of evidence to prove there wasn't trading between Europe/Asia.The explanation for D is NOT convincing. TheGracefulTerryJonesThe overall argument in comparing trade to the Yeti is that the lack of evidence cannot be used to prove something did/didn't exist.

E lays out an argument that uses lack of evidence to prove there wasn't trading between Europe/Asia.The explanation for D is NOT convincing.TheGraceful, understanding the overall position of option D is enough to reject it. If anything, D is mildly trying to support the author's point on the existence of Yeti by saying that it is possible to prove the Yeti's existence w/o actual sightings. More importantly though, D does not tell us anything about the structure of the argument. Arguing that there was no trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages because there are no written records of such trade is like arguing that the Yeti, an apelike creature supposedly existing in the Himalayas, does not exist because there have been no scientifically confirmed sightings. A verifiable sighting of the Yeti would prove that the creature does exist, but the absence of sightings cannot prove that it does not.Which one of the following considerations, if true, best counters the argument?(A) Most of the evidence for the existence of trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages is archaeological and therefore does not rely on written records. - WRONG.(B) Although written records of trade in East Asia in the early Middle Ages survived, there are almost no Europe documents from that period that mention trade at all. - WRONG.(C) Any trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages would necessarily have been ofvery low volume and would have involved high-priced items, such as precious metals and silk. - WRONG.(D) There have been no confirmed sightings of the Yeti, butthere is indirect evidence, such as footprints, which if it is accepted as authenticwould establish the Yeti's existence. - WRONG.(E) There are surviving European and East Asian written records from the early Middle Ages that do not mention trade between the two regions but would have been very likely to do so if this trade had existed.Trade may or may not have existed between Europe and East Asia but basing this argument on existence of written records is what author cites as conclusive enough. If it's so then what might cause that argument go weak.For this question specifically we have four choices that one way or another result towards one end. A - D, all of them do show that trade happened even if it is at smaller scale. Thus its all confusing after going through the answer choices until E. So, E is the only one that's unique and is the right answer, however, this is not the best way to answer a question.Answer E._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

As this is required to put the blame on the researchers as it has been done in the argument. Without this assumption the argument falls apart,as there could be many reasons for low yield such as rain, not enough effort by the farmers, crop disease etc. By stating this all those reasons are eliminated since it says that WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN yield could not have been more than this.(C) Agricultural researchers often find concrete solutions to practical problems when investigating seemingly unrelated questions.out of scope(D) Wide fluctuations in the size of the potato crop over a twenty-year period are not unusual.contradicts the argument(E) Agricultural research in Rosinia is funded by government grants.out of scopeHope you find this useful 20 yrs ago's yield: 100 m tonslast yrs' yield: 60 m tonsAgricultural researchers are to blame for this decrease (failure to develop new higher yielding strains)ASSUMPTION:The strains are not high yielding (What the strains are high yielding but some other external factors interrupted)(B) is correct!(A) Any current attempts by agricultural researchers to develop higher-yielding potato strains are futile.Not all attempts are futile. Futile in what sense, perhaps they were able to discover something else despite failure to create a high yield strain...

This completely weakens the conclusions and hence B) has to be the correct assumption, without it the argument falls apart.Negation really works well in assumption questions. I have only started trying it and it does wonders. I would suggest this technique to anyone facing issues with assumption. It will take long initially but over time you will become quick at it.Hope this helps. The structure of the sentence is - Premise + missing premise (or assumption) - conclusion.So if the missing premise is given, the conclusion will be more solid.Also there is no direct link between the given premise and conclusion, so the missing premise has to fill this void.Now let's look at option B : Strains of potatoes most commonly grown in Rosiniacould not haveproduced the yieldslast year that they once did.Now let's use negation technique and let's see whether conclusion holds or not.Negating option B : Strains of potatoes most commonly grown in Rosiniacould haveproduced the yieldslast year that they once did.So after negating the option B, the conclusion does not hold, so option is the missing premise/assumption required by the argument. Twenty years ago the Republic of Rosinia produced nearly 100 million tons of potatoes, but last year the harvest barely reached 60 million tons. Agricultural researchers, who have failed to develop new higher-yielding strains of potatoes, are to blame for this decrease, since they have been concerned only with their own research and not with the needs of Rosinia.Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?(A) Anycurrent attemptsby agricultural researchers to develop higher-yielding potato strains are futile. - WRONG. Supports the conclusion rather.(B) Strains of potatoes most commonly grown in Rosinia could not have produced the yieldslast year that they once did. - CORRECT. If that had been possible then blaming researchers makes sense.(C) Agricultural researchersoften find concrete solutions to practical problemswhen investigating seemingly unrelated questions. - WRONG. Again irrelevant.(D)Wide fluctuationsin the size of the potato crop over a twenty-year period are not unusual. - WRONG. 2nd best but doesn't impact the conclusion.

The dates assigned to samples associated with human activities formed a consistent series, beginning with the present and going back in time, a series that was correlated with the depth from which the samples came. The oldest and deepest sample was dated at 19,650 years before the present, plus or minus 2,400 years. Skeptic, viewing that date as too early and inconsistent with the accepted date of human migration into North America, suggested that the samples could have been contaminated by dissolved old carbon carried by percolating groundwater from nearby coal deposits.There are literally many layers to this passage, so let's take the time to break it all down.Skeptics suggestthat samples associated with human activities could have been contaminated by dissolved old carbon carried by percolating groundwater from nearby coal deposits.Here's how they arrived at this suggestion (i.e., conclusion):Samples from the rock shelter floor were carbon-dated.For samples associated with human activities, the assigned dates formed a consistent series.This series starts with the present day and goes back in time. The deeper the sample, the earlier the date of that sample.The oldest, deepest sample is dated at 19,650 years before present day (+/- 2,400 years).Skeptics believe that this date is too early to accept, because it doesn't match the accepted date of human migration into North America.Skeptics therefore suggest that the samples could have been contaminated -- specifically via percolating groundwater, which theoretically dissolved old carbon from nearby coal deposits, then carried that carbon into the rock shelter floor.Quote:Which one of the following considerations, if true, argues most strongly against the suggestion of the skeptics?We're looking for the choice that most weakens the skeptics' suggestion that these samples have been contaminated by old carbon in percolating groundwater. We can't really challenge the accepted date of human migration to North America. And the claim that the samples were contaminated is really the heart of the skeptics' suggestion, so the potential means of contamination is especially open to question. Let's work our way through the answer choices.Quote:A. No likely mechanism of contamination involving percolating groundwater would have affected the deeper samples from the site without affecting the uppermost sample.Hmmm, not bad! The skeptics are reacting to the oldest and deepest sample. Since they don't agree with the date assigned to that sample, they're suggesting that the samples as a whole could have been contaminated by percolating groundwater.But according to the passage, the top-layer sample dates to the present day. This dating of the top layer isn't called into question by anyone, not even the skeptics. So if (A) is true, then there's no way the samples could have been contaminated by percolating groundwater. (A) says that if this type of contamination had happened, then old carbon would have contaminated the top layer as well, and top-layer samples would NOT have been dated with the present day.Consequently, if (A) is true, then it's very unlikely that the mechanism of contamination named by skeptics (percolating groundwater) was the cause of this unusually early date in the deepest sample. (A) isn't a watertight argument killer, but it knocks back the skeptics' reasoning in a very direct way. So let's keep this choice around.Quote:B. Not every application of the carbon-dating procedure has led to results that have been generally acceptable to scientists.Huh? What do the general opinions of scientists have to do with this particular series, this particular sample, this particular date, and these particular skeptics? Choice (B) doesn't come close to addressing the conclusion that we're trying to weaken, so eliminate it.Quote:C. There is no evidence that people were using coal for fuel at any time when the deepest layer might have been laid down.We don't care whether coal was ever being used for fuel. Unless there's some concrete connection between the uses of coal and the ways that coal could have contaminated these rock samples, then what people have done with coal is irrelevant. Eliminate (C).Quote:D. No sample in the series, when retested by the carbon-dating procedure, was assigned an earlier date than that assigned to a sample from a layer above it.Choice (D) is one of those options thatsounds goodbut really says nothing at all. The passage already tells us that the order of dates in the series was consistent. This choice repeats the same fact in different wording. If (D) is true, we haven't learned anything new, and aren't closer to understanding why the deepest, earliest sample seems to be dated with a year that'stoo far in the past. So we'll eliminate (D), too.Quote:E. No North American site besides the one in Pennsylvania has ever yielded a sample to which the carbon-dating procedure assigned a date that was comparably ancient.Like choice (B), this choice points us to information that's way outside the scope of this argument and has very little to do with the specific conclusion we've been asked to weaken. If anything, this information would make us slightly more likely to believe the skeptics, because it tells us that this weird date truly is an outlier. So we'll get rid of (E).(A) is the only choice that directly addresses the logic presented by the skeptics, then offers information to cast doubt on that logic. None of the other choices come close, so even if we're getting to (A) solely through elimination, it's the best choice available.I hope this helps!

"Rumored declines in automobile-industry revenues are exaggerated.

It is true that automobile manufactures’ share of the industry’s revenues fell from 65 percent two years ago to 50 percent today, but over the same period suppliers of automobile parts had their share increase from 15 percent to 20 percent and service companies (for example, distributors, dealers, and repairers) had their share increase from 20 percent to 30 percent.The conclusion of this argument is thatrumored declines in automobile-industry revenues are exaggerated.Here's how the author gets there:Automobile manufacturers' share of industry revenues fell from 65% to 50%.Automobile part suppliers' share of industry revenues increased from 15% to 20%.Automobile service companies' share of industry revenues increased from 20% to 30%.The first thing that stands out to me in the author's logic is thatpercentage shares don't tell us anything about the total amount of industry revenues.If I am splitting a dosa between three people, and I change the size of each person's share of that one dosa, I have not made the entire dosa any larger or smaller. Which is sad, because everyone deserves their own dosa, and I would really like to magically increase the size of any dosa that I see.Quote:Which one of the following best indicates why the statistics given above provide by themselves no evidence for the conclusion they are intended to support?Getting back to the argument, the author's evidence of how the total revenue is broken down tells us nothing about whether overall industry revenues have declined. As a result, they don't really support the author's conclusion. The correct answer choice will match this observation.Quote:(A) The possibility is left open that the statistics for manufactures’ share of revenues come from a different source than the other statistics.The reason why this conclusion is poorly founded isnotthe source of evidence. The prompt states plainly that the % figures are true, and nothing in the argument depends on proving that the sources of these figures are trustworthy.Most importantly, we're not asked to pick the choice that would create the maximum amount of arbitrary doubt. We are asked to analyze the logic of the author's argument and pick the choice that shows why the author's evidence does not support the author's intended conclusion. That's why we eliminate (A) and continue looking for a choice that addresses the logical problem we've identified (% share does not tell us anything about absolute level of decline in revenue).Quote:(B) No matter what changes the automobile industry’s overall revenues undergo, the total of all shares of these revenues must be 100 percent.Choice (B) very directly lays out what's wrong with the author's logic. By affirming that all of these revenues always add up to 100%, we confirm that we really know nothing about how much revenue the automobile industry brought in over the past two years.

It is true that automobile manufactures’ share of the industry’s revenues fell from 65 percent two years ago to 50 percent today, but over the same period suppliers of automobile parts had their share increase from 15 percent to 20 percent and service companies (for example, distributors, dealers, and repairers) had their share increase from 20 percent to 30 percent.Which one of the following best indicates why the statistics given above provide by themselves no evidence for the conclusion they are intended to support?(A) The possibility is left open that the statistics for manufactures’ share of revenues come from a different source than the other statistics.(B) No matter what changes the automobile industry’s overall revenues undergo, the total of all shares of these revenues must be 100 percent.(C) No explanation is given for why the revenue shares of different sectors of the industry changed.(D) Manufactures and parts companies depend for their revenue on dealers’ success in selling cars.(E) Revenues are an important factor but are not the only factor in determining profits.OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONThe conclusion of the argument states that the rumored declines in automobile- industry revenues are exaggerated (a numerical statement), but the premises provided in support of this argument only address the market share percentages of the three groups that have automobile-industry revenues (percentage statements). The percentage statements used by the author only indicates that the percentages have changed, not whether overall revenue has changed:2 Years Ago          TodayManufacturers share                       65%             50%Suppliers share                              15%             20%Service company share                   20%             30%Total market size in %                  100%            100%Although the composition of the market has changed in terms of the market share of each group, this fact tells us nothing about industry revenues because market shares will always add up to 100% regardless of the actual dollars involved. Thus, automobile-industry revenues could have risen dramatically and the percentages above could still be accurate.Answer choice (A): Although it is true that the possibility is left open that the statistics for the manufacturers share may come from a different source, this does not address the fundamental percentage-to-number error in the argument.Answer choice (B): This is the correct answer.The answer reveals the error of the author: the changing market shares of different groups have no impact on the actual amount of revenues. In all instances, the market shares will add up to 100%, so a discussion of shifts within this 100% is meaningless as far as making a determination of whether revenues declined.Answer choice (C): This is not a flaw of the argument. The author is allowed to simply note that the shares changed and use those facts to draw a conclusion. In the argument the conclusion is faulty, but not for the reason cited in this answer.Answer choice (D): The interrelationship of the groups named in the stimulus is not an issue in determining whether the conclusion is in error.Answer choice (E): The argument is about revenues, and information about profits will not reveal the error in the reasoning._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More FistailRumored declines in automobile-industry revenues are exaggerated.

Overal, no reasoning is give to support the rumored decline. Probably, new entrants in manufacturing have started sharing the sector revenue. Thus ones like Ford lost their revenue to Japanese ones while dealers started upping by diversifying their portfolios with new entrants' cars.But no evidence give to support that makes the statistics weak. To show that there is decrease in the total revenue of the automobile industry, data to be given supporting the rumored decline. But the premises are showing the percentages of different market segments of the automobile industry. From these percentages we cannot make out whether there is a decline in the revenue.  B-correctly states that.hence the answer B! the question is tough, but POE helps to choose B.C,D,E are OFS.A is wrong b/c the argument never mentions any details or information about the sources.B looks strange, but B is logical.

GMATNinjaThe first thing that stands out to me in the author's logic is thatpercentage shares don't tell us anything about the total amount of industry revenues.If I am splitting a dosa between three people, and I change the size of each person's share of that one dosa, I have not made the entire dosa any larger or smaller. Which is sad, because everyone deserves their own dosa, and I would really like to magically increase the size of any dosa that I see.Quote:Which one of the following best indicates why the statistics given above provide by themselves no evidence for the conclusion they are intended to support?Getting back to the argument, the author's evidence of how the total revenue is broken down tells us nothing about whether overall industry revenues have declined. As a result, they don't really support the author's conclusion. The correct answer choice will match this observation.Quote:(A) The possibility is left open that the statistics for manufactures’ share of revenues come from a different source than the other statistics.The reason why this conclusion is poorly founded isnotthe source of evidence. The prompt states plainly that the % figures are true, and nothing in the argument depends on proving that the sources of these figures are trustworthy.Most importantly, we're not asked to pick the choice that would create the maximum amount of arbitrary doubt. We are asked to analyze the logic of the author's argument and pick the choice that shows why the author's evidence does not support the author's intended conclusion. That's why we eliminate (A) and continue looking for a choice that addresses the logical problem we've identified (% share does not tell us anything about absolute level of decline in revenue).Quote:(B) No matter what changes the automobile industry’s overall revenues undergo, the total of all shares of these revenues must be 100 percent.Choice (B) very directly lays out what's wrong with the author's logic. By affirming that all of these revenues always add up to 100%, we confirm that we really know nothing about how much revenue the automobile industry brought in over the past two years. We only know how the industry pie (or dosa) was allocated in proportional terms.I hope this explanation satisfied your appetite for pie, dosa, and critical reasoning! Mmm... dosas.Thank you sir...!!Beautifully explained, unfolding the logic with ease - step by step..! .. Dosa styleI too was able to narrow down to A and B, but ultimately ended with A.Although my skills are improved, this is happening often. Any suggestions on this...?Thanks again The conclusion talks about the revenue numbers, and the premise talks about the percentages. The flaw is the misleading statistics. Percentages don't share any information on whether the revenue increased or decreased.To prove the conclusion ""that the rumored declines in revenues are exaggerated,"" the author may have provided a premise along these lines - The automotive industry revenue two years back was $2 trillion, and now it's $1.8 trillion when overall manufacturing revenues because of COVID declined 60%. Why it's exaggerated because while overall manufacturing declined by 60%, manufacturing just declined by 10%, which is way better.

Paradoxically, the hospital's administrators claim that he is the best surgeon currently working at the hospital.Which one of the following, if true, goes farthest toward showing that the administrators' claim and the statistic cited might both be correct?(A) Since the hospital administrators appoint the chief surgeon, the administrators are strongly motivated to depict the chief surgeon they have chosen as a wise choice.(B) In appointing the current chief surgeon, the hospital administrators followed the practice, well established at the city hospital, of promoting one of the surgeons already on staff.(C) Some of the younger surgeons on the city hospital's staff received part of their training from the current chief surgeon.(D) At the city hospital those operations that inherently entail the greatest risk to the life of the patient are generally performed by the chief surgeon.(E) The current chief surgeon has a better record of patients'surviving surgery than did his immediate predecessor.OFFICIAL EXPLANATION(A) No. This is perhaps the second-best answer. The implication of the stated conflict of interest is that the administrators might exaggerate the abilities of the chief surgeon. However, this is speculation. If there were no conflict of interest, it would still be possible that the staff would consider him the best surgeon.(B) No. How he was appointed does not resolve the discrepancy between the chief surgeon’s reputation and his apparently poor record.(C) No. This does not resolve the discrepancy between chief surgeon’s reputation and his apparently poor record, though it does imply that younger surgeons who trained under him might be loyal to him. However, this would have relevance only if these surgeons, not the hospital administrators, claimed the chief surgeon was the hospital’s best surgeon.(D) Yes.This explains the apparent paradox well. If the chief surgeon is assigned the high-risk cases, it’s to be expected that he would have a higher number of patients who die. For example, suppose 90 percent of surgery patients at the hospital survive their operations, but only 75 percent of the chief surgeon’s patients survive. Clearly, the chief surgeon’s survival rate is much lower than the hospital’s average. But if the chief surgeon performs only open heart surgery and the national survival rate for these operations is just 50 percent, the chief surgeon’s survival rate is impressive.(E) No. The statements in the passage compare the chief surgeon’s current performance to that of the current staff, not to that of the previous staff or previous chief surgeon._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More IMO D since the chief surgeon does the most risky operations so naturally more deaths are possible Of all of the surgeons practicing at the city hospital, the chief surgeon has the worst record in terms of the percentage of his patients who die either during or immediately following an operation performed by him.

Hence how can you say the publishers are discriminated againstyour poems?adkikani, wow, this question is huge!Re highlight, I am glad to see that there is no outside elaboration creeping in. I assume the words you underlined also figure into your understanding of the conclusion.I use the negation technique only if there are two answers between which I cannot decide. But if you like negation and you are reasonably fast at it, I think it's okay to use here. IMO necessary-sufficient techniques involve too many double negatives in this case.I will lay out the meaning- and gap- based approach I used before I discuss negation and necessary-sufficient analysis.Meaning- and logical gap-based approachWhat does this publisher's conclusion-reply mean?No name on the poem = editor cannot identify author = editor cannot be prejudiced against an unknown author = publishing house and methods are fair = no unfair discrimination against HarryThat rendition is huge. Too huge. To make the argument more manageable I ask,""What logical gap exists? Which reasoning is faulty? Which connection among the above connections is too extreme, too speculative, too short-sighted, or toostupidif I just think about it for a moment?""Look carefully at the ""equals"" signs. The last three have logic that is pretty clean and not stupid.This one, however, is extreme, short-sighted, and stupid:No name on the poem = editor cannot recognize authorStripped down: a visible name on a poem is the one and only way to recognize the author of a poem.Nonsense. A poet can be recognized by a distinctive voice. (Neruda. Shakespeare. Dickinson.)Think about a distinctive singing voice such as Adele's. If Adele puts out a new song on the radio, we identify the singer as Adele before the DJ names her because Adele's voice is distinctive.Extrapolate. Good poets and artists of all kinds have a creative, idiosyncratic, and frequently recognizablestyleor ""signature.""Assuming that there is only one way to identify the author of a poem is extreme.As a result, if even ONE alternative way to identify the author of a poem is possible, then the claim that ""only names identify"" is false. ""ONLY"" is not only.The editor could easily recognize Harry's poems in another way. She could recognize Harry's distinctive style and voice in his poems.*The publisher's reply logic hinges on the presence of names as the ONLY way to identify a poet (note the word ""hence"" in the publisher's conclusion). We need an option that mentions something about poems, names, identification of poems' authors, and the editor.The publisher assumes that. . .(C) The poetry editor cannot recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his unless Trevalga's name is attached to them.Bingo. The publisher assumes that names are the ONE and ONLY way that the editor can recognize Harry's poetry.That assumption is unwarranted. It is faulty. As a result, the conclusion is logically flawed.The assumption that the publisher makes in reply to Harry isAnswer CNegationNegating (C)?  ""Unless"" is usually negated with ""even if."" Negation in this case is not simple.(C) NEGATED: The poetry editor CAN recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his EVEN IF Trevalga's name is NOT attached to them.Test this negated assumption. What happens to the conclusion?The conclusion: Harry, you are incorrect about unfairness. When the editor reviews poems she never sees the authors' names. She cannot know who writes your poems [and cannot discriminate against someone whom she cannot identify].With (C) negated, the conclusion is demolished. Negated (C) says that the editor CAN recognize Harry's poetry without a name. She CAN know who writes Harry's poems.If the editor CAN recognize Harry's poems without his name per (C) negated, then she CAN discriminate against him. The publisher's conclusion just got eviscerated.Answer CNecessary / sufficientFair warning disclaimer: I do not think this analysis is a great idea. This approach is very nuanced. Further, double negatives in this case make this approach very dense.Quote:(C) The poetry editor cannot recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his unless Trevalga's name is attached to them.""Unless"" indicates a necessary condition.X = recognize an author = SufficientY = editor sees a name = NecessaryE cannot do X unless YE cannot do X without YE can do X only if YWe need to show that the necessary condition is not actually necessary.Stated differently, we must find a way to show that the sufficient condition can happen even if the necessary condition does not happen.Attack the necessary condition. Find a way for the sufficient condition to occur without the occurrence of the necessary condition.The conclusion insists that the editor cannot identify Harry's poems because she cannot see his name on his poems. Names are the necessary condition for the sufficient condition of recognizing Harry as the author of his poems.Is there another way that the editor can recognize Harry's poems without seeing his name?If there is another way, then the allegedly necessary names are ... not necessary.More directly (and rarely as obvious in LR questions as C is in this one): is it true that names are the only way to identify a poet?If negated (see above), Answer C says that the editor CAN recognize Harry's poems without seeing Harry's name.We do not know exactly what constitutes the alternative way to identify a poet. But negated C tells us that names are not the only way to identify a poet. ""Not the only way"" absolutely implies that there is another way.If C is negated, names are not necessary.Hence the sufficient condition CAN occur (authors of poems can be identified)EVEN IF the allegedly necessary condition (a visible name) does not occur(even if there are no names).Negated answered (C) gives us the sufficient conditionwithoutthe ""necessary"" condition. The allegedly necessary condition is not actually necessary.And that not-actually-necessary condition is what the publisher assumed in reply to Harry.Answer CHope that helps.**For example, maybe he only uses titles with one word and always hides a reference to nature in his poetry.What if the editor sees a poem with a one-word title and a sneaky reference to nature? Answer: she could almost certainly identify Harry.We do not have to provide any specific examples or prove that she can identify him. We just have to identify an alternative to show that names are not the only way to identify a poet._________________— The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.Einstein— I stand with Ukraine:Donate to Help Ukraine!Signature Read More Ankit04041987Harry Trevalga: You and your publication have unfairly discriminated against my poems.

From this the publisher concludes that the editor does not know whose poems she is reviewing. This assumes that the editor cannot identify the poems of Mr. Trevalga by other means such as their style, handwriting, length, etc.(D) No. This is not an assumption of the publisher. In fact, it could strengthen Mr. Trevalga’s claim since the implication of his claim is that his poems were rejected because of a grudge, not because of their merit.(E) No. According to the publisher, whether Mr. Trevalga used his real name or a pen name is irrelevant since the editor does not see the names._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More The publisher's argument is based on the premise that the editor cannot see any submitter's name therefore cannot discriminate against anyone. However, if there is a way by which the editor can recognize a particular author (maybe style of writing, verse arrangement, etc) then that means that discrimination can still occur and Trevelga may be right in his accusation.C is the right answer, because it raises the possibilty that the editor may be able to single out Trevelga's poem for discrimination even if his name is not on the poemNegating C even makes this clearer, since it rips to smithereens the editor's ""no name, therefore fair selection"" argument.

It's totally normal for poets to submit a ton of poems without getting any accepted"".(C) The poetry editor cannot recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his unless Trevalga's name is attached to them. - Correct(D) The poetry editor's decisions on which poems to publish are not based strictly on judgments of intrinsic merit. -- Weakens editors argument(E) Harry Trevalga submitted his poems to the publisher's publication under his pen name. --this might help the publisher's argument yet it is not necessary.Answer C Ankit04041987Harry Trevalga:You and your publication have unfairly discriminated against my poems.

There is a lot of terrible argumentation going on here. Just because there is the same number of people dying does NOT mean that there are no health risks associated with nuclear weapon plants! In order to weaken this argument, I can see a few plans of attack: (1) We can show how there used to be a difference in death rates before the plants were installed - maybe the areas without weapons plants used to have 50% less people die than they do now; (2) We can attack the idea of having no health risks: people can still get sick and that would definitely be a health hazard! (3) What if these people are dying due to different things? Suppose that the people near the plants are dying due to radiation and the other people are dying due to old age? This would weaken the argument too!(A) This simply does not matter. It is completely irrelevant because we are talking about the radiation from nuclear weapons plants exclusively.(B) This is actually touching on one of our predictions but it does so in the wrong way. This actually strengthens the argument by showing that the same number of people are dying before and after the plants were installed. Maybe the plants don't have health hazards?(C) This is a pretty good weakener; not perfect, but pretty good. This shows how, even though the death rates are given as evidence, the death rates are not indicative of the totality of health hazards that could result from radiation. This would show that maybe radiation does have some health hazards, just none that are really so serious that they lead to death. I like this one and I'll keep it for now.(D) It doesn't matter how small the number of areas that have the plants are. We are trying to simply make a value judgement on the plants: are they dangerous or not? There could be one plant; there could be millions. It doesn't matter.(E) This is oddly specific and it is fairly inconsequential. With the way that this answer choice is phrased, employees simply do not matter.However, if the answer choice had said something about how there was a correlation between the employees working at the plant and an unusually high death rate then maybe that would be a much better weakener. It would thus show that radiation does pose some reason for concern if these employees are dying at alarming rates! It would also help to know if these employees only lived in areas that did NOT have a plant because then it would mean that their areas' numbers would be inflated. You can see that (E) is awfully close to this line of reasoning yet simply knowing that the researchers did not study this isn't enough to say that radiation probably does pose a health risk. Maybe if they studied these people then they would see that there actually was not any increase in sickness/death for employees at the plant. In which case, if an answer choice could easily strengthen or weaken, it probably isn't right. I will go with Ccomparing death rates isnt logical, what if people living near nuclear plants get more serious diseases. So i guess C weakens Answer CWhat if the death rates are similar but people living near nuclear plants get very serious diseases.So option C most seriously weakens the argument.Please give me kudos .

We want to make sure to consider this gap between evidence and conclusion carefully before moving on to the answer choices.Why doesn't the evidence presented here validate the conclusion?The author is assuming that because more people live in central Glenwood, more people will be within walking distance of a library in central Glenwood. Is this valid?Let's imagine that Central Glenwood is Los Angeles, population 3 million, and Central Redville is Irvine, population 200,000. Does that mean any library in Los Angeles is going to have more people within walking distance than any library in Irvine? Not necessarily. The library in Los Angeles might happen to be in a commercial area that doesn't have a lot of homes, and the library in Irvine might be in the middle of it's most crowded neighborhood.In order to use information about population to prove something about population density (people within a certain radius of a certain building), we need to have information about how big a space this population lives in.

Well, first of all, let’s realize that, although the two buildings are described by terms such as “overcrowded” and “larger,” the conclusion is not based on these characteristics—it’s only based on the number of people who will be within walking distance of the building. Moving on, the evidence provided is that there are many more people living in central Glenwood than in central Redville, and most people will walk to the library only if it’s near their house. To strengthen the argument, we need to fill in a missing piece. We know that there are more people living in central Glenwood than in central Redville, but we don’t know anything about the area of either city. If Glenwood has more people but they’re spread out over a larger area, then maybe moving the library won’t place it within walking distance for more people. So it would be to the argument’s advantage to show that the two areas are around the same size. (B) says just this, supporting the argument by making its evidence even more relevant.(A) Where the library was doesn’t help convince us that the library should either move, or stay where it is. The library’s previous location is outside the scope.(C) We’re only concerned with how accessible the library will be for walkers, so the size of the building is beyond the scope.(D) Since we’re concerned with people who can walk to the library, (D)’s mention of people who don’t live in either town can neither strengthen nor weaken this argument.(E) If people currently walk farther than standard walking distance, then perhaps the new library will cater to these people more readily. But we can’t assume that, because we don’t know where they’re walking from. Choice (E) is too vague to have any effect on the argument.• To strengthen an argument, look to bolster an assumption in that argument. If you can fill in a missing piece, you’ve made the argument stronger. If the public library shared by the adjacent towns of Redville and Glenwood were relocated from the library’s current, overcrowded building in central Redville to a larger, available building in central Glenwood, the library would then be within walking distance of a larger number of library users. That is because there are many more people living in central Glenwood than in central Redville, and people generally will walk to the library only if it is located close to their homes.Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?Pre-thinkingStrengthen questionThe assumption made here is that the 2 ""items"" compared, that is central redville and central glenwood, are somehow comparable. Just imagine if in central glenwood the library is not at a walking distance from the library users? Yes there are more people in central glenwood but per the argument they won't go there if the library is not at a walking distance from them.Herechoice Bkind of strengthens the idea that both central redville and central glenwood are similarly densely populated.(A) The public library was located between Glenwood and Redville before being moved to its current location in central Redville.(B)The area covered by central Glenwood is approximately the same size as that covered by central Redville.(C) The building that is available in Glenwood is smaller than an alternative building that is available in Redville.(D) Many of the people who use the public library do not live in either Glenwood or Redville.(E) The distance that people currently walk to get to the library is farther than what is generally considered walking distance. broallIf the public library shared by the adjacent towns of Redville and Glenwood were relocated from the library’s current, overcrowded building in central Redville to a larger, available building in central Glenwood, the library would then be within walking distance of a larger number of library users.

The fact that the library was once located between Glenwood and Redville does not address this need.(B) Yes.This question hinges on the population densities of the cities. Suppose Glenwood’s population is twice Redville’s but that the area of Glenwood is 10 times as large as the area of Redville. Then the population density of Glenwood would be one-fifth that of Redville. Hence, fewer people in Glenwood would be within walking distance of the library. The figure below illustrates the situation:However, if the areas covered by central Glenwood and central Redville are roughly the same, then the population density of Glenwood would be greater than that of Redville. Hence, there would probably be more people within walking distance of the library in Glenwood than in Redville.(C) No. The argument is predicated on the distance that people must walk to get to the library. The size of the library has no affect on the walking distance.(D) No. The argument is predicated on the distance that people must walk to get to the library. People living outside both Glenwood and Redville are probably not within walking distance of either site for the library. Perhaps for these people driving distance might be a factor, but not walking distance.(E) No. If people are walking further than the common walking distance, then for these communities the further distance is “walking distance.”Show SpoilerAttachment:2021-03-14_00-11-09.png [ 30.81 KiB | Viewed 6735 times ]_________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

You might object: There might be more people walking to the library in Glenwood even though overall fewer people use the library. This is a flaw in choice (B); nevertheless, choice (B) does weaken the argument and no other answer-choice does.(C) No. This would strengthen the argument. That increasing numbers of people would use the library in Glenwood implies that more people are within walking distance of the library in Glenwood. Although the increased use of the library may be from people who commute, this does not weaken the argument.(D) No. It is irrelevant whether those people who do not walk to the library would continue to use the library in its new location. The argument is concerned with increasing access to those people who walk to the library, not necessarily increasing the overall number of people who use the library.(E) No. If these people continue to walk to the library’s new location, the argument would be greatly strengthened; and if they now commute to the new location, then this answer-choice would be irrelevant._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Which option shows that moving the library from Redville (town A) to Glenwood (town B) would actually suck?C,DandEstrengthen the argument instead of weakening it. They say: ""Yes, move the library from town A to town B, nothing bad will happen.""Akind of weakens the argument. But the fact there are now more people who currently live in town A than in town B who walk to the library doesn't tell us much. After the library changes its location to town B, many more people from town B could start walking to the library.OnlyBweakens the argument sufficiently. It says: ""Now there are (say) 1000 people in town A who walk to the library, but there are only (say) 5 people in town B who would walk to the library if we move it to town B. Therefore, don't move the library to the new place."" (A) Many more people who currently walk to the library live in central Redville than in central Glenwood.This may seem like the correct answer, but let's dissect it a bit. If more people who currently walk to the library live in Redville than in Glenwood, this would leave room for change if the library were to move to Glenwood. Remember, the argument here is that the moving the library to Glenwood will give access to more people who will be walking distance.(B) The number of people living in central Glenwood who would use the library if it were located there is smaller than the number of people living in central Redville who currently use the library.Bingo! This one clearly undermines the argument. If the number of people in Glenwood who would use the library is less than the number of people in Redville who currently use the library, then moving the library to Glenwood will not increase the number of people who use it.This is our answer!(C) The number of people using the public library would continue to increase steadily if the library were moved to Glenwood.This strengthens the argument.(D) Most of the people who currently either drive to the library or take public transportation to reach it would continue to do so if the library were moved to central Glenwood.This strengthens the argument.(E) Most of the people who currently walk to the library would remain library users if the library were relocated to central Glenwood.This strengthens the argument.Please send kudos if this was helpful in any way! The question stem basically argues that the location of the library should be shifted as it would be much easier for the majority crowd to access the newly located library (Glenwood).Hence,we need to find an option that suggest that even it would be at walking distance still many people won't come.With just a glance,B does the same.A is not given and we cannot assume soB is correctC is strengtheningD is absolutely irrelevantE is strengthening.I hope you understood. If the public library shared by the adjacent towns of Redville and Glenwood were relocated from the library’s current, overcrowded building in central Redville to a larger, available building in central Glenwood, the library would then be within walking distance of a larger number of library users. That is because there are many more people living in central Glenwood than in central Redville, and people generally will walk to the library only if it is located close to their homes.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A)Many more people who currently walk to the library live in central Redville thanin central Glenwood. - WRONG. Present situation is of least importance. What may result upon shifting the library is more important.(B) Thenumber of people living in central Glenwood who would use the libraryif it were located there issmaller than the number of people living in central Redville who currently use the library. - CORRECT. If the pool of people is small then conclusion is likely to falter.(C) The number of people using the public library would continue to increase steadily if the library were moved to Glenwood. - WRONG. It sort of strengthens the conclusion but not the reasoning offered. Who these people are that would join the library? We are not sure about this.(D) Most of the peoplewho currently either drive to the library or take public transportationto reach it would continue to do so if the library were moved to central Glenwood. - WRONG.

With subsidy there will be outside control. The argument does not say that there will be outside control only when there is subsidy(B) not subsidized, it will not produce propaganda- Wrong. the press can still produce propoganda to cater to public demand(C) not to be subsidized, it cannot be a profit-making institution- Wrong. Currently the press is not subsidized and it is profit making.(D) to produce honest journalism, it must be profit-making institution-correct. There are only two ways the press can operate. Subsidy or profit making. While using subsidy, the argument mentions it will be in outside control and hence definitely won't be able to provide honest news.The only alternative for press to provide honest journalism is to NOT be receiving subsidy.(E) to make a profit, it must produce honest journalism- the argument says if it is making a profit it can be producing honest journalism. (Again not always). But it does not have to product honest journalism as long as it caters to public demands.Posted from my mobile device KarishmaB- Can you please how option D is correct ?My understanding of the argument - Criticism neglects that press is a profit making institution, and like any profit making institution, it has to make money to survive.the only way to make it non-profit is to get the subsidy and control from outside.Conclusion - getting subsidy is easy for propaganda but no one will subside honest journalism.Thank you.

Then it cannot be known whether rehabilitating the houses would have solved the problem. However, suppose the houses are rehabilitated first. Now, if rehabilitation fails to solve the problem, the houses can still be demolished. So rehabilitating the houses first does not preclude the possibility of destroying the houses later, whereas destroying the houses first does preclude the possibility of rehabilitating the houses later.(C) No. We do not know whether either proposal requires government funding. Besides, only one of the two proposals advocated renovating the buildings, the other advocated destroying the buildings.(D) No. This is the second-best choice. It is both too strong and too broad. The passage is about only two proposals: destruction and rehabilitation.(E) No. The question asks which of two possible decisions is right, not which method should be taken to arrive at a decision._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More AndreGWe are presented with two options/plans:A) DemolishB) Try an alternative approachWe are asked to pick a principle, if established, would help us with the decision.I will start with B)(B) When there aretwoproposals for solving a neighborhood problem(check), and only one of them wouldpreclude the possibility of trying the otherapproach if the first proves unsatisfactory, then theapproach that does not foreclose the other possibility should be the one adopted.These are key!

What I think here is as below,Option B says - when we have two options pick the one, that does not preclude the other option, first and if it is found unsatisfactory then pick the other option (that precludes the possibility of the other)While the stem says that demolishing the houses(the option that precludes the possibility of other) is the first choice (because housing is a threat to the neighbourhood), This is opposite to what is mentioned in option B.On the other hand, as per the stem, we picked one option(demolishing) over other (housing) cause the building was a threat to the neighbourhood.Option A says - when there are two options, pick the one(housing) over other(demolishing) until and unless the building is a threat to the neighbourhood. This is what we did.So I chose A over B with this thinking. Can someone please explain where I went wrong? The key to solve this question is to deeply analize the question stem. Basically, you need a principle that would determine that demolishing was the right decision or that would determine that the proposal advocated by the opponents should have been the right one.(A) When what to do about an abandoned neighborhood building is in dispute, the course of action that would result in the most housing for people who need it should be the one adopted unless the building is believed to pose a threat to neighborhood safety.This answer choice basically states that the demolishing option was the only correct choice, so the evaluation of the proposal by the opponets is irrelevant. -Incorrect.(B) When there are two proposals for solving a neighborhood problem, and only one of them would preclude the possibility of trying the other approach if the first proves unsatisfactory, then the approach that does not foreclose the other possibility should be the one adopted.This one states that you should first try the option that does not foreclose the other possibility, so it is basically saying: if you do not solve it with the first method and this one is an incorrect approach, you can try to solve the problem with the second method.-Correct(C) If one of two proposals for renovating vacant neighborhood buildings requires government funding whereas the second does not, the second proposal should be the one adopted unless the necessary government funds have already been secured.Both options would have need government funding, so this one does not affect the argument.Incorrect(D) No plan for eliminating a neighborhood problem that requires demolishing basically sound houses should be carried out until all other possible alternatives have been thoroughly investigated.This one is close, but the issue is that it only mentions that this plan should not be carried out until all other possible alternatives have been throughly investigated. Does this one mention anything about the opponents plan? Not really-Incorrect(E) No proposal for dealing with a threat to a neighborhood’s safety should be adopted merely because a majority of the residents of that neighborhood prefer that proposal to a particular counterproposal.This one just talks about a consideration for choosing the demolition option.-Incorrect_________________Make your mercy overcome your wrathSignature Read More Saunders: Everyone at last week’s neighborhood association meeting agreed that the row of abandoned and vandalized houses on Carlton Street posed a threat to the safety of our neighborhood.

It is saying that probability of the driver getting hurt in case the car is involved in the accident is lower. The discussion is on what happens when an LUT vs car gets involved in an accident. It is not on how many LUTs vs cars will get involved in accidents.(A) the government has established safety standards for the construction of light utility trucksThe arguments tells us that LUTs are exempt from car safety standards. It doesn't tell us whether there are any LUT standards. If anything, it assumes that there are NO LUT standards.(B) people who buy automobiles solely for their appearance are more likely than other people to drive recklesslyNo. As discussed, the argument is all about what happens to people when they get in an accident. It is not about how likely they are to get into an accident.(C) light utility trucks are more likely than other kinds of vehicles to be involved in accidents that result in injuriesAs discussed, the argument is all about what happens to people when they get in an accident. It is not about how likely they are to get into an accident. This is irrelevant.(D) the trucks’ rugged appearance is deceptive in that their engines are not especially powerfulHow do powerful engines lead to safety, we don't know. Irrelevant.(E) light utility trucks are less likely to meet the car-safety standards than are cars that are subject to the standardsCorrect. It says LUTs are less likely to meet car safety standards because these standards are not forced on them. The argument does assume that just because the standards are not enforced, LUTs will not meet them and hence will be lacking in safety (lower safety than car). That is why drivers in LUTs are more likely to get injured when in an accident.Answer (E)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More broallLight utility trucks have become popular among consumers who buy them primarily for the trucks’ rugged appearance. Yet although these trucks are tough-looking, they are exempt from the government’s car-safety standards that dictate minimum roof strength and minimum resistance to impact.

Or at least it has not established standards as strict as those for cars.(B) No. The conclusion of the argument does not state that people who buy light utility trucks for their appearance are more likely to be in serious accidents—just that they are more likely to be injured when in a serious accident.(C) No. An explicit premise of the argument is “if involved in a serious high-impact accident.” The argument then concludes “a driver of one of these trucks is more likely to be injured than is a driver of a car that is subject to these government standards.” So the argument does not need to assume that light utility trucks are more likely than other kinds of vehicles to be involved in accidents that result in injuries.(D) No. Nothing is stated or implied about the truck engines. However, there is an implication that the truck bodies are not sufficiently strong.(E) Yes. The argument implies that because these trucks are exempt from the government’s car-safety standards people driving them are more likely to be injured in an accident. However, it is conceivable that the government believes it is unnecessary to set standards because all the light utility trucks that have been produced have far exceeded car-safety standards. Hence, for the argument to be valid one must assume that cars are more likely to meet these standards than are light utility trucks._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Answer E(A) the government has established safety standards for the construction of light utility trucks -Irrelevant(B) people who buy automobiles solely for their appearance are more likely than other people to drive recklessly -Irrelevant(C) light utility trucks are more likely than other kinds of vehicles to be involved in accidents that result in injuries -Likelihood of getting into an accident is not required.

If many recent deaths due to CXC have been mistakenly attributed to another disease, then the 18 percent death rate would be even higher.(B) No. This substantially strengthens the argument. If many of the deaths reported to have been caused by CXC were actually due to other causes, then the 5 percent initial death rate would be lower. Hence, the increase in virulence would be even greater.(C) No. This choice is irrelevant. The effectiveness of an inoculation program has no bearing on the virulence of a disease. Inoculations are used to prevent infection by a disease. However, once infected, the disease’s virulence measures the severity of the sickness. The fact that a disease can often be prevented does not affect its virulence if caught.(D) Yes.If the mild cases are no longer reported, then the serious cases would be disproportionately represented. For example, suppose of 100 cattle with the disease, 73 have a mild case, 27 have a serious case and 5 will die of the disease. Then the death rate would be 5 percent. Now, if the 77 cattle with mild cases are not considered, then the reported death rate would be approximately 18 percent: 5/27 ≈ 18%.(E) No. The passage is about the virulence of the disease, not about an animal’s immunity to a second infection._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Imo clear D.

In this case the death percentage is 5%After 5 years even if 100 cattle are effected by the disease and if only 70 are reported to the authorities because the balance 30 had mild syptoms of the disease.

See how:HereSignature Read More The author of the passage wants us to believe that building the nuclear power plant at Littletown is safe and the power plant should be built. There are reasons given for the opposition to this thought as well as acceptance of the same.We are asked to weaken the conclusion. IMO options A, B & C are easy to eliminate. However, most of the test takers would get down to options D & E for the final fight.Option D IMO is a trap answer. Pay attention to the wording ""It leads to the further butunacceptable conclusionthat any project favored by Mayor Smith should be sanctioned simply on the basis of her having spoken out in favor of it.""Nowhere it is mentioned that this conclusion is unacceptable. In fact actually the passage concludes the same. However, test takers have been asked to negate this and come up with a possible answer.Therefore, E is better of the two. Hi,I marked B. My reasoning was that Mrs Smith swayed her opinion due to lack of technical knowledge. I am not fully convinced why choice E is correct and why B is incorrect. Would appreciate if someone can help me out here.TIA! Hineha283,As far as I understand the rule on GMAT CR is not to question or doubt the facts presented in the passage.In the passage the author clearly states thatMayor Smith is one of their few government officials with a record of outspoken,informed, and consistent opposition to nuclear power plant. The passage does not assume what is being said in option B, rather it states a fact about Mayor Smith's competency.If we choose option B we make a mistake of opposing or criticizing the cardinal fact presented about Mayor Smith. The question asks us to expose that part of the argument which is vulnerable to criticism.In option E that very part has been highlighted. I hope this line of reasoning will help you to decode why answer is option E?Meanwhile you must have read in various forums on this great website as well in various study materials that it is paramount to identify the conclusion, if there is any in an argument. I will not mince any words to state the importance of the same. I would suggest that you master this art as it has helped me to increase my accuracy on CR questions from a poor 50% to a satisfactory 80%.Also start applying strategy of pre-thinking without going through answer choices. I have observed that this strategy has helped many to crack even difficult questions. Though each and every test taker has his or her own strategy, however this one has proven to be pretty successful for a majority of test takers. Even when you see certain experts on this forum decoding and providing explanation, you might observe that they also follow the same approach.Needless to say that it is up to an individual whether to opt for a particular strategy or not.Hope this post will be of some help to you.

And that is the way you should approach this answer choice. However, once you have eliminated every other answer choice, this one stands above the rest. It is tricky because this does, indeed, strengthen our conclusion in a weak way. It shows other species going through the same process in the same area during a similar time period. And while it is a weak strengthener, it does show that this is not standalone event with the seals. There are other drops that are unexpected, meaning it can't just be the virus that has been around for a while; something else needs to be helping it. And that is why this is the correct answer. I, as stated above, will admit there is room for assumption on this (something you should never do). In all honestly, I eliminated this and then came back after going through B - E. There is no shame in doing that as long as you get the right answer!(B) By reducing pollution at its source, Northern Europe and Scandinavia have been taking the lead in preventing pollution from reaching the waters of the North Sea. --OK, so what? At best, this is an irrelevant comment because we do not care who is taking a lead to preventing pollution (Have they actually prevented pollution? How much have they saved?). At worst, this goes against our conclusion that pollution is the cause.(C) For many years, fish for human consumption have been taken from the waters of the North Sea. --OK, but who cares? Do the seals eat these fish (assumption we cannot make)? Have humans made such a large impact that the seals cannot survive (assumption we cannot make)? In the end, this is trying to make you think about biology and the real world. But do not bring that knowledge into a question!(D) There are two species of seal found throughout the North Sea area, the common seal and the gray seal. --OK, and? We have two species. This answer choice my as well have said that our seals have pink polka-dots. This information doesn't help us in any way solve the problem of whether pollution is causing our issue. If you thought that two seal populations means that one isn't effected, you have made an error as all seals are effected. Further, I think you may have lost site of the premise-conclusion relationship.(E) The distemper caused by the virus was a disease that was new to the population of North Sea seals in May 1988, and so the seals’ immune systems were unprepared to counter it. --This WEAKENS our conclusion. This does not strengthen it, and I am saddened that so many fell for this old trick (literally the oldest trick in the GMAT play book). You will usually see a strengthener in a weaken question, and a weakener in a strengthen question. This says that it is not the pollution, but the virus itself because it is new. Well, you just disproved our entire argument that it is pollution._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

If pollution is being reduced, then pollution is less likely now to be the cause of the weakening of the seals’ immune system than in the past.(C) No. We don’t know how this has affected the immune system of humans. If humans are becoming more susceptible to similar viruses, then it would support the argument. However, if humans are not becoming more susceptible to similar viruses, then it would weaken the argument.(D) No. This is irrelevant. The passage is about the general population of seals. We don’t need to know the distribution of the various species.(E) No. This would weaken the argument.

If all other factors are the same, then it must be the pollution that caused the seals to become more susceptible to the virus. So for the argument to be valid, it must assume that the virus has not increased in virulence.(D) No. This has no affect on the argument.

At issue is the difference in their health in cleared forest versus old-growth forests.(D) Yes.We are looking for an agent that would cause the deer to become less well nourished even as their food supply increases. Choice (D) offers an agent—tannins, which inhibit digestion of food. So even though the deer have more food to eat, they receive less nutrition from the food.(E) No. This should make the deer better nourished in cleared forest since there are few trees from which the parasites could drop onto the deer._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More BunuelWhen old-grow forests are cleared of tall trees, more sunlight reaches the forest floor.

In this case, it's that the light helps the shrubs to grow, which in turn should help the mule deer.But the mule deer are worse off. We need to find an option therefore that explains why the mule deer might be worse off.A- This gives mule-deer a digestion advantage. If anything, this actually deepens the paradox, since this being true should seebetter nourisheddeer, not worse.OUTB- A bit tempting, but unclear. This tells us that we're likely to see a lot of 'women and children' mule deer. However,it doesn't say anything about how this might impact overall health, any judgement we make there is our own assumption.OUTC- This information is totally irrelevant. We're looking for something that would suggest that the mule-deer will struggle, and this ain't it.OUTD- If this statement is true, it means that more sunlight = worse digestion for mule-deer.

This would help explain why the residents approve of the process, but don't want it in their community. Let's hold on to answer A.(B) High-temperature incineration is more expensive than any of the available alternatives would be and the higher costs would be recovered through higher product prices.This brings up a good point about products being more expensive if these incinerators are built and utilized. However, the prompt doesn't discuss price of goods as being a concern and if the residents approve of building the incinerators, surely they approve of the cost increases to their products. This is irrelevant.(C) High-temperature incineration will be carried out by private companies rather than by a government agency so that the government will not be required to police itself.This answer choice is irrelevant. We don't care who carries out he incineration process.(D) The toxin fumes generated within a high-temperature incinerator can be further treated so that all toxic residues from a properly operating incinerator are solids.This answer choice is irrelevant.(E) The substantial cost of high-temperature incineration can be partially offset by revenue from sales of electric energy generated as a by-product of incineration.This answer choice is irrelevant.

Incorrect(B) The hormone that would be injected into the deer is chemically similar to hormones used in human contraceptives.→ “similar to hormones used in human” is not relevant.(C) Hunting season for deer could be scheduled so that it would not coincide with breeding season.→ “Hunting season for deer could be scheduled” is not relevant(D)The hormone in question does not occur naturally in the female deer that would be injected.Negate this: “The hormone in question occurs naturally in the female deer that would be injected.” Existing amount of hormone + 10 milli gr injected = exceeding amount → Attack the conclusion. CORRECT(E) Most people do not consider deer meat to be part of their daily diet and eat it only on rare occasions.→ Easily to mistake. But this sentence says “deer meat” is not “daily diet” while the argument says “no one would eat one entire deer a day”. It’s different between “frequency of daily eating” and “eating quantity/day”. So it is not in our scope. Incorrect. D.It is the only option that tells that surplus of 10 mg hrm will be there if naturally this hrm is being generated in deer body.Posted from my mobile device arvind910619broallIn order to control the deer population, a biologist has proposed injecting female deer during breeding season with 10 milligrams of a hormone that would suppress fertility. Critics have charged that the proposal poses health risks to people who might eat the meat of treated deer and thereby ingest unsafe quantities of the hormone. The biologist has responded to these critics by pointing out that humans can ingest up to 10 milligrams of the hormone a day without any adverse effects, and since no one would eat even one entire deer a day, the treatment would be safe.The biologist’s response to critics of the proposal is based on which one of the following assumptions?(A) People would be notified of the time when deer in their area were to be treated with the hormone.(B) The hormone that would be injected into the deer is chemically similar to hormones used in human contraceptives.(C) Hunting season for deer could be scheduled so that it would not coincide with breeding season.(D) The hormone in question does not occur naturally in the female deer that would be injected.(E) Most people do not consider deer meat to be part of their daily diet and eat it only on rare occasions.Source: LSATImo BThe argument talks about the adverse effect of the hormones as we do not know what harm do these hormones cause to humans .The assumption will somehow relate the hormone used in deer to the to the harm they cause in humans .Then only we can conclude about the the hormone being safe for humans if it has any effects on humans .B is the correct assumption.HiGiven:1.	Per the proposal: 10 mg of hormones suppresses fertility in female deer2.	Per the critics: This poses health risk to people eating such meat because unsafe quantities of the hormone (10 mg) will go into the bodies of the people.3.	Per the biologists: 10 mg/per day safe for humans and no one can eat one whole deer in a day.Conclusion:Ingesting 10mg into the female deer whose meat is eaten by people is safe for those people.Pre-thinking:1.	The conclusion has been drawn on the basis of the information that 10 mg/per day is safe for humans and no one can eat one whole deer in one day.2.	What if the treated deer has some quantity of the hormone existing in its body naturally even before the treatment? That would up the total quantity of the hormone in the deer meat.3.Assumption:The deer being treated does not already produce the hormone naturally.Choice B analysisThe hormone that would be injected into the deer is chemically similar to hormones used in human contraceptives.Thescope of the argumentis whether treating the deer with 10mg hormone is safe for people eating such meat. This choice implies a similar hormone may find its way into the body of people eating the treated meat,from some other source, the contraceptives. This choice implies that a person might actually end up ingesting more than 10 mg of the chemicals in the deer hormone since the contraceptives also have similar chemicals. Hence, this choice, if anythingweakensthe conclusion.Incorrect CHoiceHope this helps._________________GMAT Prep truly Personalized using TechnologyPrepare from anapplication driven coursethat servesreal-time improvement modulesalong with a well-defined adaptive study plan.Start a free trialto experience it yourself and get access to25 videos and 300 GMAT styled questions.Our Upcoming Free Webinars:Register nowScore Improvement Strategy:How to score Q50+ on GMAT|5 steps to Improve your Verbal scoreStudy Plan Articles:How to create a study plan?|The Right Order of Learning|Importance of Error LogHelpful Quant Strategies:Filling Spaces Method|Avoid Double Counting in P&C|The Art of Not Assuming anything in DS|Number Line MethodKey Verbal Techniques:Plan-Goal Framework in CR|Quantifiers the tiny Game-changers|Tackling Confusing Words in Main PointSignature Read More @Bunnel, could you please help me understand how we are inferring that this hormone is already present in deer at 9 milligrams?

No paradox yet!)Yet in a vote in that same city, a proposition to increase funding for schools by raising taxes failed by a narrow margin to win majority approval.(Ah, here’s the “yet”. So apparently, despite the high percentage of survey responses indicating support for the city school program, that proposition didn’t even get majority approval.)Why’s that? Hm, it’s interesting they didn’t tell us anything about the drug treatment program. So I guess the city program was the only one that was “odd” in that the survey didn’t match the result. Maybe the right answer choice will pinpoint something about city program survey responders and the actual voters? Let’s see.Oh, wait! We’re looking for the LEAST likely explanation for the discrepancy.

Also, the same as we expected!Quote:(C) The proposition was only part of a more expensive community improvement program that voters had to accept or reject in total.Ah, this explains why the program might have failed. People probably supported city school program as a whole idea BUT NOT the specificities of it.Let's check other answers though!Quote:(D) A proposition for increasing funds for local drug treatment centers also failed to win approval.This wouldn’t explain why the city programs didn’t win approval. This is a “opposing group” answer that would be wrong IF were were asked to explain the discrepancy. But since we’re looking for the LEAST HELPFUL explanation.

The author believes these objections were based not on the facts but on the environmentalists’ agenda. If, in fact, some or all of these objections are shown to be invalid, then she may have a legitimate point, and it would be more reasonable to believe that they really aren’t all that concerned with the migration patterns. (A) works in this vein: It tells us that, indeed, not every proposal was challenged because it posed a threat to the environment. If we add the sentiment in (A) to the mix, then our author has good reason to doubt the validity of their claim.(B) The assumption that development-blockers always disguise their motives is neither reasonable nor helpful in this context. It’s not necessary to say that all development-blockers disguise their motives in order to argue that these people may be doing that.(C) goes way too far—we don’t know anything about people who oppose “unrestricted development,” so any assumptions about them won’t help the author’s argument.(D)’s out as well, since other reasons for objecting to the development are totally beyond the scope. They won’t help the author at all. In fact, if anything, (D) suggests that the environmentalists’ professed concern for the birds is genuine.(E) is too vague, since it talks about people who oppose development on environmental grounds in general, while we’re concerned with this specific group. Furthermore, the explanation that their concern almost always lies elsewhere is too vague to pin this rap on the environmentalists in question.• Notice that this is the last of five—count em’, five!—double-question stimuli on this section. That’s fairly high for an LSAT Logical Reasoning section. But remember that every double-question stimuli presents an opportunity to get two points for the price of one, so you should welcome these and look to use your work on the first question to help you work through the second. broallSo-called environmentalists have argued that the proposed Golden Lake Development would interfere with bird-migration patterns.

This assumes that the environmentalists opposed some of the projects for other than environmental reasons.(B) No. This is too strong. In other cases, opponents of development might be very forthright.(C) No. This does not relate to the issue of the environment.(D) No. Whether there are other reasons to oppose the development project is not mentioned in the passage. Besides, other independent reasons would not affect the environmentalists’ argument.(E) No. This is too strong.

The below was my reasoning. Do let me know if this is correct:(B) People whose real agenda is to block development wherever it is proposed always try to disguise their true motives.We dont know why and how exactly they disguise their true motives. Here, we are only concerned with the the ""so called environmentalists"".(E) When people say that they oppose a development project solely on environmental grounds, their real concern almost always lies elsewhere.Again ""people"" and ""lies elsewhere"" is vague and doesnt touch our point of ""environmentalists""Ans choice A solves these two queries.Thanks KritisoodHiScottTargetTestPrep, I solved this question with your approach, took a good 5 mins to understand it.

The environmentalists are certainly people who ""say that they oppose a development project solely on environmental grounds."" So, the category of people mentioned in (E) could include the environmentalists, and even (B) could be connected to the environmentalists, though that (B) is connected to the environmentalists is certainly not clear.So, topic or ""scope"" does not fully support eliminating choices (B) and (E).What does support eliminating those choices is that neither choice says something NECESSARY for connecting the argument's evidence to its conclusion.It is not HAVE to be the case that people whose real agenda is to block development wherever it is proposed ALWAYS try to disguise their true motives, in order for the evidence to support the conclusion that the environmentalists are disguising their true motives. Even if such people only SOMETIMES disguise their true motives, the environmentalists could be doing so.Similarly, it does not HAVE to be the case that, when people say that they oppose a development project solely on environmental grounds, their real concern ALMOST ALWAYS lies elsewhere in order for the evidence to support the conclusion that the environmentalists' true concern is not the bird migration patterns. It merely has to be the case that, IN THIS ONE CASE, the real concern of the people who say that they oppose a development project solely on environmental grounds lies elsewhere.Now, let's consider choice (A). In order for the argument to work, does it have to be the case that, as (A) says, not every development proposal opposed in recent years by these so-called environmentalists was opposed because they believed it to pose a threat to the environment. For sure it does, because, if it were the case that EVERY time the environmentalists opposed a development proposal they truly believed it to pose a threat to the environment, then the environmentalists would not have been masking an agenda, and so, the evidence presented would not support the conclusion drawn._________________Scott Woodbury-Stewart | Founder and CEO |scottwoodburystewart@targettestprep.comBiggest Sale of the Year | Get 25% Off All TTP GMAT Plans | Apply Code:BLACKFRIDAY25Perfect 5-Star Rating on GMAT Club5-Day Full Access Trial For FREESee why Target Test Prep is the top rated GMAT course on GMAT Club.Read Our ReviewsSignature Read More Understanding the argument - ­So-called environmentalists have argued that the proposed Golden Lake Development would interfere with bird-migration patterns. - concern of the environmentalists.However, the fact that these same people have raised environmental objections to virtually every development proposal brought before the council in recent years indicates that their expressed concern for bird-migration patterns is nothing but a mask for their anti-development, anti-progress agenda. - Claim that the real concern is ""their anti-development, anti-progress agenda.""

When most consumers take up this practice, over time there would be multiple iterations of recycling for these products by the time the products reach a rating of 8 or 9.This could result in a significant reduction in the amount of waste that goes unrecycled.On any day, option 2 reduces un-recyclable waste more than option 1 does.

Nothing in the argument implies that this refusal to buy high-code packaging depends on relative price of high-code packaging. And simply stating that there is a difference in price does not tell us that consumers care about this difference.

The correct answer choice is (C)This author discusses a system used to rank the level of recyclability of various plastics, asserting that consumers should avoid buying high numbered (and thus less readily recyclable) plastics in order to reduce the amount of waste that goes unrecycled. The correct response to this weaken question will likely show some reason to doubt the effectiveness of this advice.Answer choice (A): The main consideration used as a basis for the author’s advice is the effort to reduce the amount of materials that go unrecycled. Thus the cost is completely irrelevant to the inquiry, and this answer choice must be incorrect.Answer choice (B): The term “many” is extremely vague (does this mean one million? Does it mean three?), and regardless, the number of consumers currently aware of the referenced system does strengthen or weaken the argument that one should avoid the higher numbers to reduce unrecycyled materials.Answer choice (C) is the correct answer choice. According to answer choice (C), virtually every time a plastic container is recycled, its number goes up. If you adopt the author's recommendation to purchase products packaged in containers with lower numbers, you may see some reduction in the amount of unrecycled waste, but only in the short term! Over the long run, these containers will become progressively more difficult to recycle, as their numbers will go up. Eventually, their numbers will be high enough that they will never be recycled. Thus, the preference for plastics with low numbers would only have a temporary effect. Since the conclusion is concerned with making a ""long-term reduction in the amount of waste that goes unrecycled,"" answer choice (C) deals a decisive blow.Answer choice (D): This answer choice is wrong for much the same reason that answer choice (B) is incorrect. The concern is not the final price, but the amount of material that go unrecycled, so this answer choice is irrelevant and incorrect.Answer choice (E): The point at which the higher numbers are tossed into landfills does not affect the author’s conclusion, so this answer choice is incorrect. broallMost disposable plastic containers are now labeled with a code number (from 1 to 9) indicating the type or quality of the plastic.

If consumers arent aware of the grade of plastic that they are purchasing then how can anything else in the argument hold true? Kritisood, there are two issues with (B). The first is that how many is ""many""? Many means some, meaning it could be one consumer, or it could be them all. This range alone makes this answer untenable. Now, the second issue is that you are not focusing on the structure of the question. We want to reduce waste by using the number system. The argument wants us to not use higher numbers to achieve this. So we are clearly talking about those who know the number system and want to help. Our job is to weaken that position. You must work on your premises and conclusion indicators. Focus strictly on the structure: X occurs, therefore we should do Y. If you can do this, you will keep yourself on track and not get sidetracked. Lastly, if this said that all consumers do not know the number system, or most do not know, then you would have a case that that statement would weaken the argument. But as explained above, many is just a random figure used to trick people._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

Plastics with the lowest code numbers are the easiest for recycling plants to recycle and are thus the most likely to be recycled after use rather than dumped in landfills. Plastics labeled with the highest numbers are only rarely recycled.

Low numbers are easiest to recycle. High numbers are not and need to be dumped in landfills.Conclusion: Consumers can make a significant long-term reduction in the amount of waste that goes unrecycled, therefore, by refusing to purchase highest codes.So the logic is simple. Low codes are easy to recycle, high codes are not. So for a significant long-term reduction in plastics that go in landfills, don't buy high codes. What will weaken this?(A) The cost of collecting, sorting, and recycling discarded plastics is currently higher than the cost of manufacturing new plastics from virgin materials.The current cost of recycling is is irrelevant. We want that for long term benefit, most plastic consumed today should be that which is recyclable.How much of it are we actually recycling today, doesn't matter. In any case, we ar elikely recycling some because the argument says ""Plastics labeled with the highest numbers are only rarely recycled."" Well then, perhaps the lowest codes are getting at least somewhat recycled. In any case, we have the long term perspective in mind.(B) Many consumers are unaware of the codes that are stamped on the plastic containers.Whether consumers know it yet or not is irrelevant. We want to find that if consumer do start refusing to buy high number plastics, it may not have the desired effect.(C) A plastic container almost always has a higher code number after it is recycled than it had before recycling because the recycling process causes a degradation of the quality of the plastic.This tells us that after gettign recycled, a low number plastic becomes high number plastic. Here is the problem then - if people refuse to buy high number plastic, there would be no use of recycling plastic. The point of recycling is reusing. If people do not want to reuse, then any kind of recycling will stop. Then in the long term, this action will likely have a detrimental impact instead.(D) Products packaged in plastics with the lowest code numbers are often more expensive than those packaged in the higher-numbered plastics.Cost is irrelevant.(E) Communities that collect all discarded plastic containers for potential recycling later dump in landfills plastics with higher-numbered codes only when it is clear that no recycler will take them.Irrelevant. In any case it tells us that higher numbered codes are refused by recyclers sometimes.

Rather, there was a third factor that led both those who watch television and those who do not to spend less time reading newspapers.(C) No. The argument concerns the declining number (percentage) of people who read newspapers, not the average amount of time they spend in this activity.

I wouldn't think about it too deep regarding CR, because if you analyse the stem it's just a strengthening question. (A) ""The number of deaths that occurred in theater fires because theater patrons could not escape was greatly reduced when theaters were required to have aisles leading to each exit.""Option (A) provides support for the proposal through analogy. It compares the situation in theaters, where requiring aisles leading to each exit reduced deaths in fires, to the proposal to remove seats that block access to emergency exits on aircraft. The analogy suggests that implementing safety measures (removing barriers to exits) can lead to a reduction in fatalities, which supports the proposal.(B) ""Removing the seats that block emergency exits on aircraft will require a costly refitting of aircraft cabins.""Option (B) weakens the proposal because it introduces a potential downside, which is the cost associated with refitting aircraft cabins. While this information might be important for considering the feasibility of the proposal, it doesn't directly support the idea of removing seats to improve safety.(C) ""In the event of fire, public buildings equipped with smoke detectors have fewer fatalities than do public buildings not so equipped.""Option (C) discusses the effectiveness of smoke detectors in public buildings, which is not directly related to the proposal to remove seats blocking access to emergency exits on aircraft. It doesn't provide relevant support for the proposal.(D) ""In the event of collision, passengers on planes with a smaller passenger capacity generally suffer more serious injury than do passengers on planes with a larger passenger capacity.""Option (D) is not supportive of the proposal because it talks about passenger capacity and injury severity, which is different from the main concern of removing seats to improve emergency exit access and reduce fatalities.(E) ""The safety belts attached to aircraft seats function to protect passengers from the full force of impact in the event of a collision.""Option (E) discusses the function of safety belts but doesn't directly address the proposal to remove seats that restrict access to emergency exits. It focuses on a different aspect of safety.Upon reevaluation, option (A) indeed provides the most relevant support for the proposal by drawing an analogy to another context where a similar safety measure was effective in reducing deaths. this is actually a causal relationship questionthe main point is that the increased number of fatalities is due to the seats.“The number of aircraft collisions on the ground is increasing because of the substantial increase in the number of flights operated by the airlines. “  eliminates the options of other possibilitieseven though the analogy is not the strongest support, it’s the best option from all the choices.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/the-number-of-aircraft-collisions-on-the-ground-is-increasing-because-234723.html

If the landowner’s opposition to the government’s program grew more violent, then the government should have more difficulty implementing the program.(B) Yes.We are looking for an agent (other than the government’s program) that might cause the deforestation rate to decrease. Rainfall is one such agent. Heavy rainfall during the burning season might prevent the burning of the forest or at least hinder it.(C) No. This information can be interpreted as either supporting the government’s claim or undermining it. If during the previous year the government issuedfines totaling only $1 million, then increasing the fines to $9 million was probably effective. However, if during the previous year the government issued fines totaling $8.5 million, then increasing the fines to $9 million was probably irrelevant.(D) No. Although this does somewhat weaken the government’s claim, it is just as possible that direct observation might show that the deforestation rate was even lower than what the satellite data indicated.

That means activity was still ongoing and a few ( if not all perpetrators ) have been fined as well, hence it' a strong contender to weakening.I chose B over C , as I found very simple and directly weakens the claim, while as C may or may not lead to anymore interpretations of fact stated.

This doesn't mean that enforcement was not effective. Perhaps the govt was able to handle the violence and fewer trees but burnt or cut.(B) Rainfall during the usually dry 6-month annual burning season was abnormally heavy last year.The usually DRY burning season saw heavy rainfall last year. This could be the reason for reduced deforestation. Because of rain, burning would have been hampered. Hence it does call into question the Govt's claim.(C) Government agents had to issue fines totaling over $9 million to 3,500 violators of burning-and-cutting regulations.Whatever the govt recovered as fine is irrelevant. They enforced the laws and hence issued fines to violators. Perhaps that is why the violators did not burn/cut as much as they did every year before that.(D) The inaccessibility of much of the rain forest has made it impossible to confirm the satellite data by direct observation from the field.Doesn't matter whether we can confirm by direct observation. Satellite images show less deforestation.(E) Much of the money that was designated last year for forest preservation has been spent on research and not on enforcement.The argument already says: The government, which spent millions of dollars last year to enforce laws against burning and cutting of the forestSo we know that the govt spent millions on enforcing and that is what it is talking about. It may have designated billions on forest preservation and most of it might have been spent on research. But we know that the govt spent million on enforcing and that is that.

Nevertheless, Roosevelt won in a landslide.Which one of the following, if true, best explains why the poll’s prediction was inaccurate?(A) The interviewers did not reveal their own political affiliation to the respondents.(B) Only people who would be qualified to vote by election time were interviewed, so the survey sample was not representative of the overall United States population.(C) The survey sample was representative only of people who could afford telephones at a time when phone ownership was less common than it is today.(D) No effort was made to determine the respondents’ political affiliations.(E) Because the poll asked only for respondents’ candidate preference, it collected no information concerning their reasons for favoring Landon or Roosevelt.OFFICIAL EXPLANATION(A) No. This would increase the poll’s credibility. Had the interviewers revealed their political affiliations, it would have decreased the poll’s credibility because their opinions might have influenced the people they were interviewing.(B) No. This would increase the poll’s credibility. The opinions of those unqualified to vote were irrelevant since they did not vote.(C) Yes.We are looking for something that might have caused the poll to be unrepresentative of the general population. Now, in 1936, phones were not as common as today. If most of the phones were in the homes of the wealthy who held opinions that differed from those of most of the population, then the poll would not have been based on a good cross section of the electorate.(D) No. Asking for the respondents’ political affiliations would probably help determine how representative the poll was. However, if a disproportionate number of respondents were supporters of Alfred Landon, this choice does not explain why the selection process was skewed.(E) No. This might somewhat explain the inaccuracy of the poll: Perhaps the support for Landon was weak or very volatile. Nevertheless, there is a much stronger explanation offered._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More (B) Only people who would be qualified to vote by election time were interviewed, so the survey sample was not representative of the overall United States population.It makes a bit of sense, but not strongly clear enough to explain the shocking result of the election.(C) totally explains it, since the fewer people with telephones at home, the less accuate the telephone survey will be. The argument is least bothered about overall United States Population. The Argument has explicitly talked about United States voters. As maintained by the argument it is clear thatUnited States Voters are NOT an accurate reflection of the the GENERAL POPULATION.Therefore no need to assume something that is long way away.B can be ruled out in view of the reason that the information in B is beyond the facts stated on the argument.C is precise If as B says only those people who were eligible to vote were interviewed - the survey was in fact representative of the population. B just stitches two contradistinct scenarios - if eligible voters alone were interviewed - how can the sample not be representative? You don't want to count the opinion of those who would not have been eligible to vote in the first place So B does not explain the discrepancy. In this question, we're looking for a discrepancy between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome of the election. The answer choice should give us a reason for this discrepancy.(A) The interviewers did not reveal their own political affiliation to the respondents.If the interviewer HAD REVEALED their own political affiliation, it may have altered the answers they received, however this says that they did not reveal their own political affiliation, so it should have not had any effect on the results of the survey.(B) Only people who would be qualified to vote by election time were interviewed, so the survey sample was not representative of the overall United States population.Again, if the opposite of this had happened, it would have had an effect on the survey results, but it didn't and therefore it should have not had any effect on the survey results.(C) The survey sample was representative only of people who could afford telephones at a time when phone ownership was less common than it is today.Bingo! This shows that there may be a reason as to why only some people in the population were excluded from the survey.(D) No effort was made to determine the respondents’ political affiliations.This is irrelevant. Even if respondents were asked about their political affiliations, it would not have had an effect on the outcome of the survey results.(E) Because the poll asked only for respondents’ candidate preference, it collected no information concerning their reasons for favoring Landon or Roosevelt.Again this is irrelevant. Even if the poll collected the reasons for favoring Landon or Roosevelt, it would not have had an effect on the survey results.The correct answer is answer choice C.Please give kudos if this was helpful in any way! I believe that this question is seriously flawed;We know that 10k people were surveyed from different places/genders, and we are looking for a bias in the survey to conclude that the survey results didn't show the reality.(C) The survey sample was representative only of people who could afford telephones at a time when phone ownership was less common than it is today.How can someone's affording a telephone in 1936 may create a bias? Can you safely assume that they are rich?even if you assume so, does being rich create some sort of tendency to vote for someone? This option stands on a few links of further assumptions, making it quite a feeble and shaky of  an answer...

The conclusion is reached based on the premise that disposable plastic ""percentage"" in disposable waste is increasing. Since the premise uses percentage rather than absolute numbers, there can be speculation that either the total waste has reduced & plastic waste has remained constant or the plastic waste has increased & total waste has remained constant or it could be both have reduced or increased simultaneously with plastic waste at a lower/higher rate than total waste. Hence a weakener should provide a reason for the increase in percentage of plastic, by proving that the cause is not that the attempts to decrease plastic waste are failing.(A) Because plastics create harmful pollutants when burned, an increasing percentage of the plastics handled by waste managementcompanies are being disposed of in landfills. - Irrelevant. Incorrect,(B) Although many plastics are recyclable, most of the plastics disposed of by waste management companies are not. - We are talking about disposable plastics, hence incorrect.(C) People are more likely to save and reuse plastic containers than containers made of heavier materials like glass or metal. - If this was true than the amount of plastic disposed will be low, but we don't know whether the percentage is going to be low. Incorrect(D) An increasing proportion of the paper, glass, and metal cans that waste management companies used to handle is now beingrecycled. -This as per our analysis, shows that the total disposable waste has reduced, hence percentage of plastic has increased. Therefore we cannot say that attempts to decrease plastic waste are actually failing, because of the reason stated in premise. Correct.(E) While the percentage of products using plastic packaging is increasing, the total amount of plastic being manufactured has remained unchanged. - Which indirectly means more plastic is being recycled, however it doesn't explain the increase in percentage of plastic being disposed.

How the waste management companies handle the disposal is irrelevant.(B) No. The passage claims that the amount of plastic being thrown away by the public is not decreasing. Whether this plastic is recyclable or not is irrelevant.(C) No. This should decrease the percentage of plastic waste discarded by the public. In spite of this, the percentage is actually increasing.(D) Yes.Suppose an increasing proportion of paper, glass, and metal cans are being recycled. Then even if people are throwing away less plastic than before, the percentage could still increase since there could be considerably less of the other materials being thrown away.(E) No. The argument is about the amount of plastic people throw away, which is only loosely related to the total amount of plastic manufactured. Perhaps industry uses plastic more efficiently in equipment that is not disposed in landfills. Then consumers will use a greater percentage of the total amount of plasticproduced._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More broallWaste management companies, which collect waste for disposal in landfills and incineration plants, report that disposable plastics make up an ever-increasing percentage of the waste they handle. It is clear that attempts to decrease the amount of plastic that people throw away in the garbage are failing.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) Because plastics create harmful pollutants when burned, an increasing percentage of the plastics handled by waste management companies are being disposed of in landfills.(B) Although many plastics are recyclable, most of the plastics disposed of by waste management companies are not.(C) People are more likely to save and reuse plastic containers than containers made of heavier materials like glass or metal.(D) An increasing proportion of the paper, glass, and metal cans that waste management companies used to handle is now being recycled.(E) While the percentage of products using plastic packaging is increasing, the total amount of plastic being manufactured has remained unchanged.OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONThe structure of the argument, in simplified form, is as follows: Premise: Disposable plastics make up an ever-increasing percentage of the waste they handle. Conclusion: Attempts to decrease the amount of plastic that people throw away in the garbage are failing. Based on our discussion of numbers and percentages, it should be clear that the conclusion is flawed: a numbers conclusion (“amount”) cannot be drawn solely from percentage information because the overall total could change dramatically. As you attack the answer choices, look for an answer that addresses this error.Answer choice (A): The argument is about how people act when throwing away garbage, an issue that occurs before the waste management companies receive the trash. On the other hand, this answer discusses how the waste management companies dispose of plastics, an issue that occurs after they have received the waste. Because the two issues occur at different times in the cycle, this answer does not attack the argument and is incorrect.Answer choice (B): Like answer choice (A), this answer raises an issue that occurs after the waste management companies have received the waste.Answer choice (C): This answer addresses how people act prior to throwing away garbage, but it does not suggest that the amount of plastic that people throw away is not decreasing. The author would probably counter this statement by saying that regardless of the fact that people are more likely to save plastic containers, that tendency is only relative to glass and metal containers, and people are still throwing away plastics in an ever-increasing percentage (and thus amount).Answer choice (D): This is the correct answer.The answer indicates that the waste management companies no longer receive as much paper, glass, and metal as they used to. Since this clearly affects the amount of trash that they process, this would also affect the percentages of each type of waste. If the amount of paper, glass, and metal drops by a large amount, the percentage of plastic in the waste would rise even if the actual amount of plastic waste was reduced. The following example shows how this is possible:Previously        NowTotal garbage                     100               20 (in units)Plastic garbage                    20 (20%)      10 (50%) (in units)Other garbage                     80 (80%)      10 (50%) (in units)In the example, plastic garbage has risen from 20% to 50%, but the actual amount of plastic waste has decreased from 20 units to 10 units. Consequently, because this answer raises a scenario that could disprove the argument, it is the correct answer.Answer choice (E): The amount of plastic being manufactured is not the issue in the stimulus; how much plastic is thrown away is the issue. In all respects this is a classic numbers and percentages Weaken problem. Accordingly, we can use this discussion to highlight a general rule for handling Weaken and Strengthen questions paired with numbers and percentages stimuli: To weaken or strengthen an argument containing numbers and percentages, look carefully for information about the total amount(s)— does the argument make an assumption based on one of the misconceptions discussed earlier?_________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More nguyendinhtuongWaste management companies, which collect waste for disposal in landfills and incineration plants, report that disposable plastics make up an ever-increasing percentage of the waste they handle.

So we need to provide an explanation for how the amount of plastic people throw away may actually be decreasing. How can disposable plastic make up an ever increasing percentage of the waste then?Say if waste were 100 tonnes. Disposable plastic - 50 tonnes (50%), Other - 50 tonnesNow if waste is 60 tonnes, disposable plastic - 40 tonnes (66.6%), other - 20 tonnesIf ""other"" is decreasing faster than plastic, the percentage of plastic will increase even if the actual amount is decreasing.(A) Because plastics create harmful pollutants when burned, an increasing percentage of the plastics handled by waste managementcompanies are being disposed of in landfills.We are discussing the total amount of plastic that goes in landfills and is incinerated. So the split between them is irrelevant.(B) Although many plastics are recyclable, most of the plastics disposed of by waste management companies are not.Whether the plastic is recyclable or not is irrelevant. We are only concerned about the quantum of disposable plastic being handled by these companies.(C) People are more likely to save and reuse plastic containers than containers made of heavier materials like glass or metal.If people are more likely to reuse plastic, and not other materials, disposable plastic should not be making up an ever increasing percentage of waste. But our premise has to be true.(D) An increasing proportion of the paper, glass, and metal cans that waste management companies used to handle is now beingrecycled.This says that more and more paper, glass and metal is being recycled. So less is going to the waste management companies. So it says that ""other"" may be decreasing quite a lot. So this could certainly imply that the amount of plastic that people throw away is decreasing but since other is decreasing more, the plastic makes up a higher percentage of the waste. This information certainly weakens our claim that people are not reducing the amount of plastic they are throwing. It is certainly possible that they are. Hence it weakens our conclusion.We don't have to prove beyond doubt that the conclusion is wrong. We just have to sow a doubt.(E) While the percentage of products using plastic packaging is increasing, the total amount of plastic being manufactured has remained unchanged.The total amount of plastic being manufactured is irrelevant. We are only talking about disposable plastic that reaches waste management companies.Answer (D)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More A question like this you ignore a small clue like the word ""percentage"" and you end up getting the question wrong. I think the key to getting the CR question is give attention to detail. Waste management companies, which collect waste for disposal in landfills and incineration plants, report that disposable plastics make up an ever-increasing percentage of the waste they handle. It is clear that attempts to decrease the amount of plastic that people throw away in the garbage are failing.Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?(A) Because plastics create harmful pollutants when burned, anincreasing percentage of the plastics handled by waste management companies are being disposed of in landfills. - WRONG. What about people? Irrelevant thus.(B) Although many plastics are recyclable,most of the plastics disposedof by waste management companies are not. - WRONG. So what!!. Nothing more is said. Irrelevant.(C) People are more likely to save and reuse plastic containersthancontainers made of heavier materials like glass or metal. - WRONG. Okay, good enough to make one pause and notice. But it does not let's us identify whether there is an increase or decrease in plastic being thrown away. A comparison is unhelpful.(D) An increasing proportion of the paper, glass, and metal cans that waste management companies used to handle is now being recycled. - CORRECT. POE helps. Half the information was shared in the passage and other half here in this option. True that attempts as far as plastic is concerned might be failing but it might be equally possible that plastic amount thrown is constant and other material waste is, at the same time, decreasing(as it is being recycled).(E) While the percentage of products using plastic packaging is increasing, thetotal amount of plastic being manufactured has remained unchanged. - WRONG. Neutral. Plastic packaging usage is irrelevant, though not fully but how plastic is being wasted is not at all inferable from this. All we can say that since manufacturing is constant and since packaging usage is increasing, it suggests that plastic is being reused. So, it takes further assumptions to be made for this to happen. We don't have a sure situation about how plastic is being thrown away in the garbage.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

So we are looking for something that might offset the decrease in ozone in the upper atmosphere. Look at choice (D). It states that as ozone decreased in the upper atmosphere it increased dramatically in the lower atmosphere. Thus, overall there would be more ozone in the atmosphere and therefore more ultraviolet light would be absorbed before reaching the Earth’s surface.The answer is (D).The first part of choice (A) is irrelevant. The second part rather than reconciling the discrepant facts would add another discrepant fact: If the amount of cancer causing ultraviolet light reaching the Earth decreased, the incidence of cancer should also decrease, not increase.Choice (B) is irrelevant since the passage is about what happened in North America, not Brazil. Even if it were relevant, it would strengthen, not reconcile, the apparently discrepant facts.Choice (C) explains why the ozone is being depleted in the upper atmosphere, but this does not reconcile the discrepancy.Choice (E) offers another explanation for why the ozone in the upper atmosphere is being depleted, but again this does not reconcile the discrepancy_________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More A) Not related to the topicB) Incorrect comparison leading extending the cause and effect scenarioC) Mentions the reason for the depletion of the ozone layer but does not solve the paradoxD) properly resolves the paradoxE) Not related to the topicPosted from my mobile device Most of the ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earths atmosphere from the Sun is absorbed by the layer of stratospheric ozone and never reaches the Earths surface.

So the argument does not need to assume that most inventions by university faculty members would be profitable, nor even that some inventions would be profitable.

Here, is my understanding of option B- since universities have a motive to suppress information until they are patented, so these motives somehow benefit the universities(monetory, outwitting competition...whatever).Option B states that Most inventions by university faculty members would be profitable(benefited) if patented. so, if the motives are not benefited , then suppressing information does not make sense.

The argument states that a university would have a ""motive to suppress information about apotentiallyvaluable discovery until the patent for it has been secured."" The university does not know in advance which patents will be valuable. They might suppress information about 100 patents... perhaps all 100 will end up being valuable, but perhaps only some (or none!) will be valuable. Regardless, according to the author, the universities are still motivated to suppress the information to avoid sharing POTENTIALLY valuable information._________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More HelloOut of curiosity, if the question were the BOLD face type of question, which would be the conclusion?

If there is any third language shared by both of Eng and Mbar then we can find a relation and conclusion does not told true. Negating D destroys the Conclusion and hence is the Answer. This is a Find Assumption question type.Conclusion: neither borrowing nor relatedness caused similarity. We need to make sure that the conclusion (cause --> effect) stands. So, we need to establish that borrowing or relatedness did not happen. Option (D) does what we need. As mentioned in previous posts, negated (D) completely kills the argument, i.e. (D) says that relatedness did occur. The structure of the reasoning is the stem provides 2 factors (""related language"" & ""word borrowing"") that the argument says does not cause the similarity in words common between the 2 languages.Although there is neither any apparent relationship between the 2 languages mentioned nor borrowing of words involved, the question stem frames it in such a way that we are only investigating the relations between these two factors in connection with the end outcome.However, what if the 2 languages themselves borrowed the words from another language? Also, what IF the languages are related to each other in a way that they descended from the same 'parent' language?The conclusion would fall apart, and we need to place a defending assumption to protect the conclusion. Therefore, we need to find an answer that says the two languages aren't 'related' in any extend in that they dont descend from the same parent language, nor do the two languages borrow the word 'dog' from the same third language.Answer: D English and the Austronesian language Mbarbaram both use the word “dog” for canines. These two languages are unrelated, and since speakers of the two languages only came in contact with one another long after the word “dog” was first used in this way in either language, neither language could have borrowed the word from the other.

The generalization is a jump If it fails to consider all scenarios that could break it apart.Logically, we have A and B. The author concluded that A and B are not related to each other. Is that so? Imagine two guys(A and B) meet at a soccer field, they've never met each other before. Does that mean they are unrelated? Usually, we would think yes; however, it is possible that they share a father and that father(let's call him C) hides them from seeing each other. So now they are both related to each other or A and B are related to C. We must prove that they don't have the same father in other to say ""YES, they are unrelated"".Let's check out the answer choice.The argument requires that which one of the following be assumed?Quote:(A) English and Mbarbaram share no words other than “dog.”This does not change the fact that they still share the word ""dog"". So it is possible that they borrow that word from each other. (A) can't be assumed.Quote:(B) Several languages besides English and Mbarbaram use “dog” as the word for canines.What other languages do does not help to prove the relationship between E and M — ultimately, the generalization. (B) is out.Quote:(C) Usually when two languages share a word, those languages are related to each other.If it is USUALLY so, then the generalization that SOMETIMES both language are not related in not true. (C) is out.Quote:(D) There is no third language from which both English and Mbarbaram borrowed the word “dog.”Now C is introduced as not a possible third party that connects A and B. Hang on to this.Quote:(E) If two unrelated languages share a word, speakers of those two languages must have come in contact with one another at some time.[/quote]So If two unrelated languages share a word, they must have NOT come in contact with one another at sometime.

With these, it's important to look as closely as possible at the premises and the conclusion. Make sure you don't change the words as they're written to fix a bad argument. Often, the arguments made in CR passages are so terrible that, in taking notes, you end up making them better. Don't do it!Politician: From the time our party took office almost four years ago the number of people unemployed city-wide increased by less than 20 percent. The opposition party controlled city government during the four preceding years, and the number of unemployed city residents rose by over 20 percent. Thus, due to our leadership, fewer people now find themselves among the ranks of the unemployed, whatever the opposition may claim.Conclusion: Fewer people are unemployed because of partyPremise: Our party saw unemployment increase by less than 20%, other party by more than 20%At first glance, this may look like a typical ""percent isn't the same as number"" kind of question. But look closely at the conclusion. The party is saying fewer people are unemployed, when they admit that there was an INCREASE in unemployment! Just because it was less than 20% doesn't make it a decrease. In reality, the fact cited totally undermines that conclusion.The reasoning in the politician’s argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that(A) the claims made by the opposition are simply dismissed without being specifiedProblem: This argument has nothing to do with what the opposition did or didn't do. In fact, all that stuff about opposition is a big red herring. All we care about is whether or not there are ""fewer people"" unemployed now than before the party took power.(B) no evidence has been offered to show that any decline in unemployment over the past four years was uniform throughout all areas of the cityProblem: Unemployment density is immaterial; we just need the overall number.(C) the issue of how much unemployment in the city is affected by seasonal fluctuations is ignoredProblem: This doesn't address the data we've been given, and is irrelevant.(D) the evidence cited in support of the conclusion actually provides more support for the denial of the conclusionAnswer: Yep. If unemployment INCREASED, even by 2%, that would lead one to the conclusion that MORE people are unemployed, not fewer.(E) the possibility has not been addressed that any increase in the number of people employed is due to programs supported by the opposition partyProblem: This is tempting, because it makes it sound like the opposition might have had some effect on a later increase in employment.

Even so, he does implicitly address the opposition, which apparently claims that agreater or equal numberof people are unemployed now than four yearsago.(B) No. This is irrelevant. The politician’s claim is aboutthe “number of people unemployedcity-wide”and does not concern differences in employment that might exist among different neighborhoods in the city.(C) No. This is irrelevant. Since both the politician’s party and the opposition’s party held office for four years, annual seasonal fluctuations should have noimpact on overall employment.(D) Yes.Although the percentage increase in unemployment was less than it was under the previous administration, it still did increase. So by definition, there are now more people unemployed than before.(E) No. The politician’s claim concerns programs that were implemented under the leadership of his party.

There is no claim offered by the opposition that is simply dismissed. We would need to be able to point to a claim made by the opposition that the author dismisses, and even then the claim would need to be central to the politician's argument.(B) is too specific. The argument never concludes that the unemployment was uniform throughout all areas of the city.(C) is too narrow in scope. Definitely season fluctuations could be at play, but could not influence numbers that span a four year period.(E) is the most tempting of the incorrect answers. It addresses a possible alternative cause, but those programs under the opposition, might yet have been supported by the politician's party._________________My CR Guide:HereMy RC Guide:HereMy Legendary Debrief:HereDaagh's AWA Responses.

Nightmare007It will be clear if you draw a venn diagram.Answer is ACan you please clarify how you draw a venn diagram in this scenario? Pls help i could not solve this question komalpatnaPls help i could not solve this questionHey There, Look at this question this way.We're given two scenarios by the farmer. Let me remind you that this is his opinion, and he thinks that there are no in-betweens.1) Two Types of People (only) - Rich or Poor. Let me tell you again, there are no in-betweens. For eg: You cannot be Middle Class. You're either Rich or you're Poor.  Applies to when You're a Farmer.2) Again, Two types of people- Honest or Dishonest. No in-betweens, for eg: You cannot be partially honest, partially dishonest. Also Applies to when You're a Farmer.Pre thinking- Look at what the farmer's done here, He says - All Poor Farmers are Honest. He specifically means If you're a poor farmer, you are honest. There's no way you can be dishonest. All the dishonesty is elsewhere in the other category, and you can see that in the conclusion when he says - All Rich Farmers are dishonest.ExplanationSince this Question is about Farmers, we'll have to consider these two scenarios for a farmer. One easy way to solve this is to observe that all the options other than option A are talking about People/A Person in general, and we're not worried about that here. We're trying to figure an assumption, given the two scenarios in the case of FARMERS ONLY. Hence, you can eliminate all the others out and blindly select option A.The other way to solve this would be to take each option and negate them to see whether the negated version breaks the argument/conclusion. A is the best option because, it says -every honest farmer is poor. The negated version of this would be Every Honest Farmer isn't poor. Think about it, doesn't this go against what we've seen so far? We were told that every poor farmer is honest, and from what I've said above about there being no in-betweens, that must mean that every honest farmer must also be poor. The negated version of A would mean that hey, there are rich farmers who are honest too, and this dismantles the argument.Sure hope this helped! A poor farmer was fond of telling his children: “In this world, you are either rich or poor, and you are either honest or dishonest. All poor farmers are honest. Therefore, all rich farmers are dishonest.”The farmer’s conclusion is properly drawn if the argument assumes that(A) every honest farmer is poor(B)every honest personis a farmer(C)everyone who is dishonestis a rich farmer(D)everyone who is pooris honest(E)every poor personis a farmerThree parameters based on which this passage can be understood:1. Rich/Poor2. Honest/Dishonest3. FarmerWhat we forget to think of is that there must be PEOPLE who are NON FARMERS. This is where this passage plays you out.If you get that it becomes easy for you to pick A, otherwise making tables helps but again it would be correct only if you pick the people/non farmer part.C and D are the choices that take most of the time among the four wrong ones - C is easier between them to eliminate. D took the toughness to another level by testing only honest and poor aspect.HTHs.Answer A._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More BunuelbroallA poor farmer was fond of telling his children: “In this world, you are either rich or poor, and you are either honest or dishonest.

Since such cases would have no effect on a dog’s health, there would be no medical need for costly surgery.(B) No. At first glance, this choice seems good. But the passage already implies that both purebred and nonpurebred dogs suffer genetically determined abnormalities. The more important issue is the percentage of purebred dogs who have genetically determined abnormalities versus the percentage of nonpurebred who have genetically determined abnormalities.(C) No. This should not affect health care costs for the dogs. The key phrase in this answer-choice is “natural life spans.”(D) No. The argument concerns only the avoidance of costly medical bills.(E) No. Even if the offspring of nonpurebred dogs are as likely to have abnormalities as the offspring of purebred dogs, the passage implies the current generation of nonpurebred dogs is less likely to have the abnormalities._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More APurebred dogs have genetic abnormalities that are expensive to correct. Nonpurebred dogs don't have these abnormalities. To reduce the risk of cost you should get a nonpurebred dog so you don't have to pay to correct the abnormality.The assumption is that the abnormality has to be corrected.Statement A states that the abnormality does not affect the dogs health and therfore is not needed. bhatiagpPurebred dogs are prone to genetically determined abnormalities.

Nature is nature!a) tells us that 3 eyes and two tails are ok as long as does not affect fido well-beingb) talk aboutnongenetically diseases --out of scopec) shorter life spans do not necessarily mean $$$$ vet billsd) PB purchase price > NPB price has nothing to do with medical bills. This ans choice wants you to make an assumption if cheaper than less maintenance problems. Think Lada.e) old news.  E tells that NPBsmay haveGDA, well we already know that.  If you recall, the evidence tells us that says ""NPBrarely suffer"" -- rarely but do suffer i.e. may have it It is hard to improve on gixxer's explanation. The conclusion is that you will have less risk of high medical bills for your dog if you choose a non-purebred. The evidence is that purebred dogs are more prone to genetic abnormalities, and that it costs thousands of dollars to correct these abnormalities surgically. To weaken the argument, you have to break the connection between the evidence and the conclusion. ""Breaking the connection"" means contradicting or undermining the assumption. In this case, one assumption is that if your dog has such an abnormality, you DO have to correct it surgically. Choice A definitely undermines this assumption.As always, we do not care whether A is actually TRUE or not; the question is whether the argument is weaker if it IS true. I don't think very many purebred German Shepherds would agree with A, once their hips freeze up. But that's irrelevant for CR.Choice B does not help. It is true that the argument also assumes that there is NOT some other kind of expensive-to-correct problem to which NON-purebred dogs are MORE susceptible. But B does not attack this assumption; it only says that there is another set of conditions to which they are EQUALLY susceptible. It would need to identify something that is MORE common among non-purebreds in order to weaken the assumption. Simplify the argumentPremise -1. Cost of correcting genetic abnormalities in purebred dogs can reach several thousand dollars.2. Non purebred dogs rarely  suffer from these abnormalities.Conclusion -Dog owners who want to reduce the risk of incurring costly medical bills for their pets would be well advised to choose non purebred dogs.Option A - Correct.this suggests that owning purebred dogs may not be as costly as was thought earlier because those abnormalities do not affect a dog's well-being.Option B - Incorrect.But the cost of owning purebred dogs is still much higher because of costs of correcting genetic irregularities.Option C - Incorrect.Kind of strengthens the argument. Suggests that owning purebred dogs may not be such a good idea after all.Option D - Incorrect.Not relevant as we are talking about reducing ""medical bills"", not ""purchase prices"".Option E - Incorrect.It does not have any effect on my conclusion that choosing non purebred dogs reduces medical bills._________________Crackverbal Prep Teamwww.crackverbal.comSignature Read More Purebred dogs are prone to genetically determined abnormalities.

True, but this doesn't mean that the owner might not have to do a surgery for an abnormality resulting out of genetics at some point of dog's lifetime. The fact/premise clearly says ""Purebred dogs are prone to genetically determined abnormalities.""IMO E is a better choice as the owner might end-up buying an offspring (theoretically nonpurebred dog) with such abnormality. In that case owner has to incur the cost of surgery anyhow.Please correct me in case I'm wrong. IMO the OA isnt very convincing. To weaken an argument is to weaken the assumption or to do the conclusion. The answer A is to weaken the assumption while the answer E is clearly to me weakening the conclusion. The sense is that to choose non purebred dogs might still incur risk of high cost to cure abbormalities for their pets due to their offspring might still have abnormalities.

Therefore, waiting until a medical journal has published the research findings that have passed peer review is the price that must be paid to protect the public from making decisions based on possibly substandard research.This is an assumption question, so we need to look at the conclusion and premises once again.Conclusion: Medical journal peer review is only way people can avoid bad research.Premises: Research subject to peer review before publication in journals, to be sure false research doesn't get out(A) unless medical research findings are brought to peer review by a medical journal, peer review will not occurANSWER: When in doubt about the correct answer on an assumption question, try the NOT test.

If you use negation technique on option D , it will not break the conclusion necessarily .(D) all medical research findings are subjected to pre publication Peer reviewNegated statement :Not allmedical research findings are .......Since medical research in question may or may not be subjected to peer review . It doesn't affect conclusion. oh, not again, I just thought C is right, until i realize that the public and findings has nothing to do with findings and peer review. Too many details bump into head while reading even though I take paraphrase the whole passage!!!Guideline to negate unless statement.The negation of a conditional statement is NOT another conditional statement. When negating a conditional, you're really negating the relationship expressed between the two properties from the original statement. So A-->B negated becomes ~(A-->B), which can be rephrased as ""A even if not B"". The key to that is saying B is not really necessary, A can occur and it doesn't matter if B occurs or not. The statement ""A-->~B"" isn't precisely accurate, it's expressing the polar opposite of the original idea, not the logical opposite.As far as an ""unless"" statement, the trick is to change ""unless"" to ""even if"" or ""if not"", and negate both elements in the sentence. So ""I'll kill you unless you give me $100"" becomes ""I might not kill you even if you don't give me $100"".

In the option 'A' will the negation be (using the idea from chesstitans' reply),- Even if medical research findings are brought to peer review by a medical journal, peer review will not occur.It seems to say that even when medical journal asks the peer group to review the research, it will not do so. This does makes the conclusion fall apart but sounds a bit weird.Can you please help ?ThanksSaurabh Chose correct answer by POEMedical research findings are customarily not made public prior to their publication in a medical journal that has had them reviewed by a panel of experts in a process called peer review. It is claimed that this practice delays public access to potentially beneficial information that, in extreme instances, could save lives. Yet pre publication peer review is the only way to prevent erroneous and therefore potentially harmful information from reaching a public that is ill equipped to evaluate medical claims on its own. Therefore, waiting until a medical journal has published the research findings that have passed peer review is the price that must be paid to protect the public from making decisions based on possibly substandard research.The argument assumes that(A) unless medical research findings are brought to peer review by a medical journal, peer review will not occur  (THIS SHOULD CORRECT ANSWER THROUGH POE) SO PER REVIEW WILL NOT OCCUR IF THE RESEARCH FINDGS ARE NOT SUBMITTED FOR PEER REVIEW(B) anyone who does not serve on a medical review panel does not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate medical research findings( not really , there could be people with necessary knowledge and expertise,who would work in other spheres )(C) the general public does not have access to the medical iournals in which research findings are published(FALSE INFO. PUBLIC HAS ACCESS, BUT ITS ACCESS IS DELAYED DUE TO PEER REVIEW)(D) all medical research findings are subjected to pre publication Peer review(  THIS IS TOO EXTREME.  THERE COULD BE SOME MEDICAL RESEARCH FINDINGS NOT REQUIRING PEER REVIEW)(E) peer review panels are sometimes subject to political and professional pressures that can make their judgments less than impartial(OUT OF SCOPE. NOT CONCERNED WITH PRESSURES) I can tell right away that A is the answer here. The passage says that the peer review process of medical journals is the only way to ensure that incorrect medical information not reach the public. However, if we use negation on A we get that peer review will occur if medical research findings are not bought to peer review by the journals. This completely collapses the argument by telling us that peer review, which the passage tells us is the only method by which the incorrect information can be caught, can be done without the journals. So, A is the correct answer.

This strategy has worked in terms of the total number of tickets sold, yet such discounts have actually resulted in a decrease in airlines’ profits.Now we have to determine which answer choice resolves this paradox.(A)	The behavior of this 10% would not be able to account for the decrease on profit.(B)	The difference in cost regarding small cities and large cities is not mentioned and is thus irrelevant.(C)	Popular flights that were completely filled pre-discount are now going to make a loss because people are paying less for tickets for which they would otherwise have paid more. This is a problem esp. when we read the last part of the answer choice, which explains that the discounts aren’t attracting any new customers to the unpopular flights. Had the unpopular flights attracted passengers that wouldn’t have flown they could be deemed somewhat successful.(D)	This answer choice shows that more people – albeit a very small number – are flying, which would suggest that profits would increase very slightly. Regardless, it in no way accounts for the decrease in profits.(E)	Awareness is important, i.e. if people aren’t aware of the discounts then they are unlikely to take advantage. Still, lack of awareness does not account for why profits decreased. We need an answer choice that gives us a reason why the across-the-board discounts did not work. Only (C) does this by citing that popular flights were losing money, and unpopular flights were not able to fill more seats.Let me know if that makes sense._________________Christopher LeleMagoosh Test PrepSignature Read More calreg11It might seem that an airline could increase profits by reducing airfares on all its flights in order to encourage discretionary travel and thus fill planes.

Are they new travelers who would not have otherwise purchased tickets except at a discount?  Or are they travelers who were intending to pay full-face but took advantage of a good deal?(B) No. This is irrelevant.(C) Yes.If across-the-board discounts attract passengers who displace full-fare travelers on filled flights, then revenues will decrease on those flights. Further, if no new passengers are attracted to usually unfilled flights, there will be no corresponding increases in revenue elsewhere. The net effect is a decrease in revenues and thus profits.(D) No. This is actually a pretty good choice, but it’s not the answer for two reasons: 1) There is a stronger answer-choice. 2) It has a flaw: Although only a small number of people who had never flown before were persuaded to do so, it’s possible that people who already travel by air greatly increased the number oftrips they take.(E) No. This is irrelevant._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More +1 for C. only reasonable option.

In this question though I know that C is correct answer, but I wasn't able to eliminate B. Because in the passage it is already mentioned that computers translate with an 80% accuracy rate. So, that would already cover the grammar and meaning error. Please tell what am I missing.First, C is clearly irrelevant here, while B talks about something that might be relevant (accuracy), so C will be the right answer -- in a test situation, you wouldn't want to spend any time working out why B is wrong.Answer B is a bit strange, for the reason you mention. I don't think you'd see a similar answer choice on the GMAT, because B seems to bring a premise into question, and I can't think of any GMAT questions that tread close to that line. It is, however, reasonable to wonder what that ""80% accuracy"" figure means, since, as the stem says, translation is a very complex task. What is the numerator and what is the denominator? If the author of the argument arrived at the 80% figure by one method (counting spelling mistakes per word, say), but there are many other methods you could use (grammar mistakes per sentence, say, or meaning errors per paragraph), there might not be a reasonable way to measure accuracy numerically. That's how I read answer B -- even reading the stem, the possibility is still open that accuracy can't correctly be numerically compared, and it would be useful to know if that's possible. There might be a better way to think about it, but in any event, if we learned we can't compare translators numerically, the 80% figure in the stem becomes meaningless, so we have less evidence that computer translators are competent. So B certainly matters.On a side note, I find the argument bizarre: an 80% accuracy rate in translation sounds hopelessly bad to me, but the author of the stem seems to want us to think it's very good._________________now teaching gmat focusianstewartgmat.comSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

The argument mentions only diet because it is the particular factor that Myrna and Roland are discussing.(D) No. Just the opposite. Roland states that a low-fat diet would be “unappealing” and would require a “lifetime of sacrifice.”(E) No. This is irrelevant: Roland’s argument is directed toward those who do have a higher-fat diet. In fact, if many people have a low-fat diet instead of the “average” diet, his argument could be weakened if those people found their nutritional lifestyle to be worthwhile._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Answer is BSpotted this right after finishing reading Roland's reply, before getting to the question.

I understand that the extreme of ""...onlyrelevant factor..."" could make it an incorrect choice, but nevertheless, I don't see how B is making a better assumption.In answer B, I can't find a reference to ""satisfying"" food. Roland only mentions the ""appealing"" part of the low-fat diet. But even then, the premise and his main conclusion focus on life expectancy rather than the appeal of the food. The first thing that we need to know is that it is an inference question to Roland's argument. In this case, Roland argues, it is not worth it to sacrifice an appealing diet with only a three more month length of life.So we need to look for the answer which supports the joy of food tastiness and does not support the low fat diet in the sacrifice for a short time of living.(A) it is desirable to live in such a way as to length life as much as possible => It is part of Myrna's point of view, not Roland.(B) a low-fat diet cannot readily be made appealing and satisfying to a person who follows it regularly => This choice support Roland's opinion. So it is a correct answer.(C) diet is the only relevant factor to consider in computing influences on length of life. => Noone states that diet is the only factor.(D) the difference in tastiness between a diet in which fat represents 30 percent of total calories and one in which it represents 37 percent is not noticeable. => this answer is totally different from Roland's argument. Roland supported that the high fat diet is significantly tastier than the regular diet, so that it is not worth sacrificing.(E) not everyone in the country eats the average diet => Not relevant. (A) it is desirable to live in such a way as to length life as much as possibleTrap answer. This is Myrna's argument.(B) a low-fat diet cannot readily be made appealing and satisfying to a person who follows it regularlyThis justifies Roland's argument. If a low-fat diet cannot be made appealing, than there's truly no point in sacrificing the appealing, high-fat diet, only to lengthen one's life by an average of 3 months.(C) diet is the only relevant factor to consider in computing influences on length of lifeThis is out of scope. Both Myrna and Roland are discussing diet and how it effect's one's length of life. We're not concerned with anything that may or may not effect one's length of life in this scenario.(D) the difference in tastiness between a diet in which fat represents 30 percent of total calories and one in which it represents 37 percent is not noticeableThis would actually discredit Roland's argument. If the difference in taste is unnoticeable, than one would choose the healthier alternative without question.(E) not everyone in the country eats the average dietThis is irrelevant. By saying ""average"" we know that some are above that and some are below that.The correct answer is answer choice B.Please give kudos if this was helpful in any way! Roland's argument assumes that(A) it is desirable to live in such a way as to length life as much as possible  --> This is exactly the reverse of what Roland assumes. Wrong.(B) a low-fat diet cannot readily be made appealing and satisfying to a person who follows it regularly  --> If we negate this, the argument falls apart. Correct.(C) diet is the only relevant factor to consider in computing influences on length of life. --> Ronald is not worried about ways to compute length of life. Wrong.(D) the difference in tastiness between a diet in which fat represents 30 percent of total calories and one in which it represents 37 percent is not noticeable --> Reverse is true for Roland. Wrong.(E) not everyone in the country eats the average diet --> Negate it. Still argument holds.

Therefore, assuming the costs of using the two types of machines are equal, an accountant who uses a computer generally can earn more per hour than an accountant who uses an adding machine.Which one of the following is an assumption that would make the conclusion in the passage a logical one?(A) More accountants use computers than use adding machines.(B) The more hours an accountant spends on the job, the more money he or she will earn.(C) The more calculations an accountant performs, the more money he or she will earn.(D) An accountant who uses an adding machine can charge a higher hourly rate than one who uses a computer.(E) In general, accountants vary in terms of the number of calculations they make and the amount of money they earn.Source: LSATOFFICIAL EXPLANATION(A) No. The argument is concerned with comparisons between accountants who use adding machines and those who use computers. It is not concerned with comparisons of the relative number of accountants in each group.(B) No. This does not relate to computers.(C) Yes.Since the passage states that a computer can perform more calculations is less time than an adding machine (in other words, more calculations per hour) and that an accountant can earn more per hour using a computer, the passage needs to assume that the more calculations an accountant performs, the more money he or she will earn.(D) No. This contradicts the argument. The argument concludes that “an accountant who uses a computer generally can earn more per hour than an accountant who uses an adding machine” whereas this answer-choice states the opposite.(E) No. This is irrelevant. The argument is concerned with two categories of accountants—those who use adding machines and those who use computers._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More I have a doubt for this question.The Conclusion states - ""Therefore, assuming the costs of using the two types of machines are equal, an accountant who uses a computer generally can earnmore per hourthan an accountant who uses an adding machine""The conclusion talks about ""per hour"" rate whereas option C supports overall income.What if the accountant with adding machine has higher per-hour rate but works less hours and accountant with computer puts in more no. of hours then earnings of accountant with computer has more overall income but still per hour rate is low.broall!

Group of work exhibited showed bias - it's hard to understand how charging less is bias towards the work exhibited.

Charging more fee for submission is not the same as selecting the ones to exhibit.Charging less is correct in that it is biased towards photographs but that is only for submission of the work and not the selection.Thought option D made sense, it tells us photographs get more coverage therefore that gives us a reason why more of photographs were chosen from an equal number of submission.Have I gone wrong somewhere? sumitshresthaGroup of work exhibited showed bias - it's hard to understand how charging less is bias towards the work exhibited.

This actually couldweakenG's argument, because it provides evidence that the selection committee (or whoever makes these decisions) has chosen other media over photography in the past. So, the show is not necessarily ""bias[ed] in favor of photographers"" -- there just happened to be more photographs this year, just as there happened to be more paintings or sculptures in previous years. But, again, whether the selection committee was biased in the past does not tell us whether the committee was biased this year.Choice (B), on the other hand, provides strong direct evidence related tothisyear's show. (B) tells us that it is more expensive to submit a painting or sculpture than to submit a photograph. So the barrier to entry is higher for photographs. This represents a clear bias, one that would apply tothisyear's show.

The correct answer choice could be an entirely separate leg of support for the claim. Say, for instance, that an answer choice told us that several judges went on a rampage and smashed all of the submitted sculptures and paintings, but left the photographs alone -- that would definitely show bias in favor of photographers, even if it is unconnected from the original support for G's claim.Similarly, (B) provides an additional leg of support for G's claim. If you stuck (B) into the passage, it would be just one more reason for G to conclude that the show has a bias in favor of photographers.Because (B) supports G's claim of bias, it is the correct answer.

For Anita to call into question the adequacy of this guidance through an example, the case in the example has to pose an ethical dilemma. If the case does not present an ethical dilemma to journalists, her example is completely irrelevant to the matter in discussion.Let me give you a somewhat parallel example:A: the fire code is adequate because it covers all scenarios that may pose a fire hazard to a buildingB: but the code clearly doesn't cover scenarios where a child is playing with a dog unsupervisedIn what scenario could we conclude from B's statement that A's claim about the code is incorrect?

But in the typical case, where a journalist has some information but is in a quandary about whether it is yet important or “newsworthy,” this guidance is inadequate.In order to conclude properly from Anita’s statements that Marcus’ general claim about traditional journalistic ethics is incorrect, it would have to be assumed that(A) whether a piece of information is or is not newsworthy can raise ethical dilemmas for journalists(B) there are circumstances in which it would be ethically wrong for a journalist to go to press with legitimately acquired, newsworthy information(C) the most serious professional dilemmas that a journalist is likely to face are not ethical dilemmas(D) there are no ethical dilemmas that a journalist is likely to face that would not be conclusively resolved by an adequate system of journalistic ethics(E) For a system of journalistic ethics to be adequate it must be able to provide guidance in every case in which a journalist must make a professional decision.Source: LSATMarcus: For most ethical dilemmas the journalist is likely to face, traditional journalistic ethics is clear, adequate, and essentially correct.Anita: But where a journalist has some information but is unsure about whether it is yet important or “newsworthy,” this guidance is inadequate.The question stem is interesting here:In order to conclude properly from Anita’s statements that Marcus’ general claim about traditional journalistic ethics is incorrect, it would have to be assumed thatIf we were to conclude from Anita's statement that Marcus' statement is incorrect, we would have to assume what?Marcus says that for most ethical dilemmas, traditional journalistic ethics is adequate. Anita says that if a journalist is unsure whether some news is newsworthy, this guidance is inadequate.Note the disconnect here - Marcus talks about 'ethical dilemma' case while Anita talks about 'whether something is newsworthy'We will need to assume that the two are connected.(A) whether a piece of information is or is not newsworthy can raise ethical dilemmas for journalistsPerfect.(D) there are no ethical dilemmas that a journalist is likely to face that would not be conclusively resolved by an adequate system of journalistic ethicsNot correct. Marcus says 'for most ethical dilemmas.'  He doesn't say 'all ethical dilemmas...'So we don't have to assume that there is no ethical dilemma that cannot be resolved. So we don't need to evaluate it any further.Answer (A)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More Hello from the GMAT Club VerbalBot!Thanks to another GMAT Club member, I have just discovered this valuable topic, yet it had no discussion for over a year.

It is the implication that matters.(B) The manufacturers who wish to call their product “lite butter” plan to change the composition of the product so that it contains more water than it now does.If the product contains more water, it would probably be healthier. There is no reason to stop the renaming then.(C) Some individuals who need to reduce their intake of cholesterol are not deterred from using the reduced-butterfat product by the negative connotations of the term“imitation.”This option only speaks about ""some"" individuals. Other individuals may be deterred by the negative connotations. Hence renaming would be good way to attaract those individuals.(D) Cholesterol is only one of many factors that contribute to the types of health problems with which the consumption of excessive amounts of cholesterol is often associated.We are not concerned if cholesterol is the only factor or one of many factors. The fact that cholesterol is harmful is what matters.(E) Most people deterred from eating “imitation butter” because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has.Most people have already found other products. So renaming the product might not attract customers who are already aware of the butterfat content.Source: LSAT manjot123GMATNinjasir please explain why e and not a?It looks like0akshay0andniteshwaghrayhave identified why (E) is the best choice and why (A) doesn't do anything to weaken the argument. Nice work on this one!I'll add a reminder that it's very important to clarify the conclusion that you're trying to weaken before you begin eliminating answer choices.In this case, the author concludes that manufacturers should be allowed to label reduced-butterfat butter with the name ""lite butter."" The author implies that if the label change is allowed, then the public will stop avoiding reduced-butterfat butter. And once they start buying reduced-butterfat butter, they will be eating fewer foods with higher butterfat content.Quote:(E) Most people deterred from eating “imitation butter” because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has.However, (E) introduces evidence that most people who are avoiding reduced-butterfat butter are in fact eating alternative foods withlowerbutterfat content. Switching over to ""lite butter"" won't lead to a reduction in the consumption of higher butterfat foods. So if (E) is true, then the whole point of this conclusion turns out to be moot.Quote:(A) The manufacturers who prefer to use the word “lite” instead of “imitation” are motivated principally by the financial interest of their stock holders.Choice (A), on the other hand, runs away from the point of this conclusion. We just spent precious moments of our lives reading about how butterfat content impacts the health of people who consume it. The conclusion focuses on the effect of a label change on consumer decisions about what butter to buy. Why, then, would we care about the motivations of butter manufacturers?Well, we don't. That's why we eliminate (A).aditliverpoolfcWhat is wrong with answer choice C?Quote:(C) Some individuals who need to reduce their intake of cholesterol are not deterred from using the reduced-butterfat product by the negative connotations of the term ""imitation.""This choice tells us thatsomepeople who need to eat less cholesterol look at ""imitation"" butter and buy it anyway. So these people are already ending up where the author would like everyone to end up: eating reduced-butterfat butter.Thissoundslike it weakens the argument. But let's take one more look at that argument:Quote:Since the public should be encouraged to eat foods with lower rather than higher butterfat content and since the term “imitation” with its connotations of falsitydeters many peoplefrom purchasing products so designated, manufactures who wish to give reduced-butterfat butter the more appealing name of “lite butter” should be allowed to do so.OK, so:The argument tells us up front that the term ""imitation""deters manypeople from buying ""imitation"" butter.Choice (C) tells us that the term ""imitation""fails to deter somepeople from buying ""imitation"" butter.Wait, what? Is choice (C) really telling us anything new? When we read closely, we see that (C) is really just re-phrasing part of the argument that we already know. And the conclusion is pointed at themanypeople who have been deterred, notsomepeople who haven't been deterred.If (C) is true, the argument isn't really affected at all. That's why it's a much poorer choice than (E).On a more personal note, I hope all of this clarification didn't reduce your appetite for delicious, delicious butter. Especially clarified butter.

The argument is about health, not profits.(B) No. This would strengthen the argument. The argument’s intent is to lower the public’s intake of butterfat, and increasing the water content in a product would decrease the amount of butterfat.(C) No. Although this does weaken the argument, there is a stronger answer-choice that applies to most, not just some, individuals.(D) No. This is irrelevant.(E) Yes. The purpose of the recommendation is to lower the amount of butterfat that people eat. But “Most people deterred from eating ‘imitation butter’ because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has.” So if the labeling change prompted people to return to the original product, they would actually increase their butterfat intake._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More vikasp99When butterfat was considered nutritious and healthful, a law was enacted requiring that manufacturers use the term “imitation butter” to indicate butter whose butterfat content had been diminished through the addition of water.

Ended up taking (B) B says it is a necessary condition that the farmers know an animals “evolutionary history.”The evolutionary history is the reason why the animals conform to certain practices and resist others. All the farmer (according to the passage) would need to do is observe these animals behaviors.Knowing the animals evolutionary history and WHY it behaves the way it does is not a necessary condition to apply a certain practice that an animal will resist or conform too.We are not told, but presumably they could view the animals’ responses and test different practices out. Again, we don’t know, but this possibility is left open.Because animals resist certain practices and we are told that this resisting lead to inefficiency, it can be inferred that a farmer COULD possibly increase efficiency by tailoring the methods to the behavior of the animal.  Which is effectively what E says.Thinking about something in the real world:You are baby sitting someone else’s baby.  You see that when you let him use a toy he stops crying, but when you take that toy away from him he resists and cries.The reason why he does this is because his parents have spoiled him (maybe?) by letting him play with his toys all the time. In order to get him to stop crying (a more “efficient practice”), it wouldn’t be a necessary condition that you know his whole history of being spoiled and how he evolved to be a brat.I don’t know if that’s a good analogy, but it’s the best I can come up with based on what the facts in the passage are lollakshya14What's the difference between (B) and (E)?

The passage seems to suggest the opposite. Eliminate.B. In order to implement efficient farm management practices, it is necessary to be familiar with the evolutionary history of farm animals.We do not know that the ""other"" farm management practices are as a result of knowing the evolutionary history of farm animals. Those who implement those may not be aware of such history. Eliminate.C. In order to create farm management practices that cause less pain and distress to farm animals ,a significant loss of efficiency will be required.The opposite is suggested by the passage. Eliminate.D. Farm Management Practices that cause the least amount of pain and distress to farm animals are also the most efficient management practices.Here, the problem is with the words ""least"" and ""most"". While the passage does suggest that less distress is correlated with more efficiency, we do not know if it holds true at the extremes as well. At this stage, given that the correct relationship is specified, we can hold on to this option.E. Some changes in farm management practices that lessen the pain and distress experienced by farm animals can result in gains in efficiency.Correct answer - gives the correct relationship between distress and efficiency without being absolute in either direction. Since this option is so much better, we can now eliminate option (D).Hope this helps._________________SrinivasanCrackVerbal Prep TeamGet Free Access to Your GMAT Kickstarter CourseKnow More About Our GMAT Personal Tutoring ServiceCheck Out the CrackVerbal GMAT Online CourseWatch the Latest GMAT Strategy & Concept videos on YoutubeSignature Read More Definitely E. Inference questions are all about the softness in the language.I think the main reason B is wrong is because it equates knowing behavioural tendencies with knowing the evolutionary history of the animals. We can't infer this. One may implement efficient farming practices without knowing the history of why the animals behave the way they do. Farmers simply need to understand the animals' behavioural characteristics/traits. Slight shift in language but it changes everything.Is this the right line of logic? Let me know, friends!Posted from my mobile device I had a tough time with A), are there others who can chime in? CEdwardI had a tough time with A), are there others who can chime in?A is out because the passage states that behavioural tendencies are a result of evolutionary history of the species. No where in the passage is it implied that these tendencies can be altered through farming practices. In fact, we are told that if we change farming practices to better suit these tendencies, farming efficiency will improve.So for those reasons, we cannot infer A. Hope this makes sense. A. Some of the behavorial tendencies of farm animals can be altered by efficient farm management practices -- The argument does not suggest that. The argument states that techniques that ""closely conform"" to the behavioural tendency of farm animals are more efficient than those that conflict with such tendencies. Eliminate. This answer choice is not brought out by the argument.B. In order to implement efficient farm management practices,it is necessary to be familiar with the evolutionary history of farm animals. -- Eliminate. What ""may be"" necessary is familiarity with behavioural tendencies of farm animals and not evolutionary history per se.C. In order to create farm management practices that cause less pain and distress to farm animals ,a significant loss of efficiency will be required. -- Eliminate. Strong tone. ""significant loss of efficiency"". No where does the passage say that transitioning to techniques that cause less pain will involve loss of efficiency. On the contrary, the passage says that farming techniques that conform to behavioural tendency of farm animals are less painful and are more efficient.D. Farm Management Practices that cause the least amount of pain and distress to farm animals are also the most efficient management practices. -- Eliminate. Again too strong a tone (least amount of pain; most efficient) that isn't suggested by the passage, which is more comparative (and not superlative in nature).E. Some changes in farm management practices that lessen the pain and distress experienced by farm animals can result in gains in efficiency. -- True. The passage says that by switching to techniques conforming to behavioural tendency, gains in efficiency are likely to emerge.

However, the controversy may have increased the desire to attempt the replication.(C) No. If anything, this would support the original results.(D) Yes.Both sets of experiments are subject to faulty measurements. So for the argument to be valid, it must assume that original experiments were more likely to have been marred by faulty measurements than were the replication experiments.(E) No. The scientists do not need to assume this to make their conclusion. Besides, it’s difficult to conclude anything from the statement that the original researchers observed their results only once. Perhaps the observation was a false artifact, or perhaps the single observation indicates the difficulty of the experiment and explains the failure to replicate the result._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More D, conclusion can be true only if the replication experiments are assumed to be not effected by faulty measurements (A) the original experiments had not been described in sufficient detail to make an exact replication possibleWe aren't concerned with how the original experiments had been described, just the conclusion and how it was reached.(B) the fact that the originally reported results aroused controversy made it highly likely that they were in errorThis doesn't explain why the measurements in the original experiment would have been wrong.(C) the theoretical principles called into question by the originally reported results were themselves based on weak evidenceIf they were originally based on weak evidence, this would undermine the replication.(D) the replication experiments were not so likely as the original experiments to be marred by faulty measurementsBingo!

The author argues that educational television is a contradiction in terms (aka not educational), but his only line of reasoning is that television is different from a classroom.  Each of the points that he makes refer to how television varies from a classroom, and this his overall assumption is that if it's not the same as what is done in a classroom, it cannot be educational.  This leaves us with answer choice B.There are some other smaller assumptions being made here that have to do with each of the points being touched upon (e.g. assuming that learning cannot take place with constantly changing visual images).  Because the correct answer addresses such a glaring flaw, this is a pretty low percentile question.I hope this helps! i eliminated option A, D and E n zeroed down to B and C and finally selected option C , which is wrong.now when i again put options B and C into the premise, option B appears to be the clear winner.in option B the word 'only' is restricting the scope, and it is restricting the television only for educational purpose and hence he is coming to the conclusion that educational television programs is contradictory.in option C, the word 'some' is making it a weak contender. and it means educational television is for other purposes as well other than educational purpose.

Hence she will transfer to another university where there are no fraternities, assuming that No Fraternity = No alcohol problem, in turn implying that there could be universities with No alcohol problem.Yolanda's Argument's Analysis : Yolanda, counter's Sally's argument by justifying that there is no relation between Alcohol problem & fraternities at a university. She states that ""Alcohol problems exist at all universities, including those where there are no fraternities"", hence there are actually no universities with No Alcohol problem & breaks Sally's assumption for No fraternity = No alcohol problem.Answer is E. Yolanda's Argument gives us solid clues to Sally's assumption.

The answer choice that is correct will contain the question that, when answered, will reveal whether the conclusion is strong or weak.In order to understand the application of the Variance Test, we will look at each answer choice in succession and thus we will not perform an initial analysis of the argument (on the LSAT we would analyze the stimulus closely). Also note that on the test we would not apply the Variance Test to each answer choice, only to the Contenders. For teaching purposes, we will apply the Variance Test to each answer in an effort to give you the best possible understanding of how the technique works.Answer choice (A) asks if National Laboratories has performed tests on other machines from Bolter Industries. To apply the Variance Test, we should supply different and opposing answers to the question posed by the answer choice. First, try the answer “No.” With this answer, would the fact that National Laboratories did not perform safety test on other Bolters machines affect the safety of the Bolter’s hedge trimmer? No—this does not help us evaluate the safety of the hedge trimmer. What if the answer was “Yes” ? Would the fact that National Laboratories performed safety tests on other Bolters machines affect the safety of the Bolter’s hedge trimmer? Not at all. So, regardless of how we respond to the question posed in answer choice (A), our view of the conclusion is the same—we do not know whether the claim that the hedge trimmer is safe is good or bad. According to the Variance Test, if the answer is correct, then supplying opposite answers should yield different views of the conclusion. Since our assessment of the conclusion did not change, the Variance Test tells us that this answer is incorrect.The question in answer choice (B) is, “How important to the average buyer of a power hedge is safety of operation?” Again, apply the Variance Test and supply opposite answers to the question in the answer choice. In this case, try “Very Important” and “Not Important.” If safety of operation is very important to a buyer of hedge trimmers, would that affect whether the Bolter’s hedge trimmer itself is safe? No. Let’s look at the opposite side: if safety of operation is not important at all to a buyer of hedge trimmers, would that affect whether the Bolter’s hedge trimmer itself is safe? No. Because our view of the validity of the conclusion does not change when we consider different responses to the question posed in answer choice (B), the Variance Test tells us that answer choice (B) is incorrect.The question in answer choice (C) is, what were the results of the tests of Bolter’s hedge trimmer? Using the Variance Test, supply one response that says, “Bolter’s hedge trimmer failed the safety test.” If this is true, then the conclusion is unquestionably weakened. Now supply a response that says, “Bolter’s hedge trimmer passed the safety test.” If this is true, then the conclusion is strengthened. So, depending on the answer supplied to the question posed in answer choice (C), our view of the validity of the argument changes: sometimes we view the conclusion as stronger and other times as weaker. Therefore, according to the Variance Test, this is the correct answer. In this instance, the Variance Test reveals the flaw in the argument: the author simply assumed that being tested means safety is assured. Nowhere in the argument did the author mention that the hedge trimmer passed the tests, and the Variance Test reveals this flaw.In answer choice (D), “Yes” and “No” responses do not change our view of the argument, and answer choice (D) is incorrect.In answer choice (E), “Yes” and “No” responses do not change our view of the argument, and answer choice (E) is incorrect.The key thing to note is that the Variance Test is applied according to the nature of each answer choice. Thus, with some answer choices we might supply responses of “Yes” and “No,” and other answer choices might require responses of “0%” and “100%,” or “Very Important” and “Not Important.” But, in each case, the answers we supply are opposites, and the correct answer is always the one that changes your view of the validity of the conclusion when those different responses are supplied. If your view of the argument does not change, then the answer choice is incorrect.Keep in mind that the Variance Test should only be applied to the contending answer choices. In the discussion above we applied it to every answer choice, but we did this simply to show how to effectively apply the Variance Test. During the actual test you would only want to apply the Variance Test to two or three answer choices at most._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More Icecream87Advertisement: Most power hedge trimmers on the market do an adequate job of trimming hedges, but many power hedge trimmers are dangerous to operate and can cause serious injury when used by untrained operators.

But may cause injury to untrained operators. BI's hedge trimmers are tested by NL, which is a trusted safety company. So BI's hedge trimmers are safe.To evaluate the argument, we have to check whether the BI's hedge trimmers are really safe to be used even by untrained operators.(A) Has National Laboratories performed safety tests on other machines made by Bolter Industries? - Incorrect - Irrelevant(B) How important to the average buyer of a power hedge trimmer is safety of operation? - Incorrect - We are not concerned about the average buyers importance to safety. We are concerned about the safety of BI's hedge trimmer.(C) What were the results of National Laboratories’ tests of Bolter Industries’ hedge trimmer? - Correct - If the results were positive then its safe. If not then its not safe to be used.(D) Are there safer ways of trimming a hedge than using a power hedge trimmer? - Incorrect - Irrelevant(E) Does any other power hedge trimmer on the market do a better job of trimming hedges than does Bolter Industries’ hedge trimmer? - Incorrect - IrrelevantAnswer: C C, this question is prepared by CR bible powerscore, a reliable source for gmat, not just LSAT.PLease specify the source of the question. I'd go with C. If the results are bad, you definitely don't buy a product the usage of which is safe. Conclusion :  I buy BHT then I get surety that BHT is safe.Pre-think: Why BHT is safe. Because BHT has been tested by national Laboratories or Because BHT has passed national laboratories test :D.Option C fills the gap.(C) What were the results of National Laboratories’ tests of Bolter Industries’ hedge trimmer? - Correct - If the results were positive then its safe. If not then its not safe to be used. The analysis of the argument is 'if you buy a power hedge trimmer from Bolter then you are buying the trimmer whose safety is assured"" because it testing for trimmers manufactured by Bolter is done by National Laboratories which is the most trusted brand.

"Once consumers recognize that a period of inflation has begun, there is generally an increase in consumer spending.

Fares on the city-run public buses in Greenville are subsidized by city tax revenues, but among the beneficiaries of the low fares are many people who commute from outside the city to jobs in Greenville.

Paraphrasing the argument in the stem, the argument goes like this:'taxes should be spent on things that benefit the people who actually pay the taxes'and concludes that, since many using the bus don't pay taxes, that taxes should not be used to pay for the bus.Then answer choice C says: 'if bus fares are raised, the people who *don't* pay taxes (they're 'exempt') will be hurt'. Well, the entire point of the argument is that tax money should not be spent to benefit those who don't pay taxes. To weaken the argument, we need to establish that the plan would disadvantage people who *do* pay taxes, not those who don't. So C doesn't weaken the argument at all. It's immaterial that the councillors all agree that these tax exempt citizens should be helped; that just means that they will need to weigh two factors (the force of the argument, and their desire to help people who would be hurt because of the argument's conclusion) when deciding on their policy.I'm curious where the question is from._________________now teaching gmat focusianstewartgmat.comSignature Read More Ya i got (d).The question asks us to weaken ""except"" which means that four WRONG options will weaken the argument and one RIGHT will either strengthen or will be irrelevant.Conclusion:bus fares should be raised enough to cover the cost of the service.Weaken>>bus fares should not be raised.a. rellocation of businesses is not favourable to the city.Good enough reason of not increasing the bus fares.b. air pollution .WEAKENc. everyone agrees that low income brcket citizens should be exempt.So increasing bus fares is not a good idea.d.

But since the city buses are funded by the city tax revenues, which in turn is due to the taxes paid by the residents, Counselor argues that the non tax payers(those who are travelling from outside the city) are also enjoying the low fare, whereas only the taxpayers(residents of Greenville) should be benefited. So, to hinder the free-loaders(or the low fare loaders) the counselor wants to increase the fare.E says the affluent are already paying 5% taxes, implying city taxes will suffice the funding of bus services.-weakenD : In case the fare is not increased, the counselormayresort to increasing the tax to cover the cost of service. Now the choice D makes sense that voters are against the tax increase- Doesn't weaken the conclusion. (C) Increasing transit fares would disadvantage those residents of the city whose low incomes make them exempt from city taxes, and all city councilors agree that these residents should be able to take advantage of city-run services.VeritasKarishmaCan you please let me know why is Option C not correct here? I was confused between Option C and D. And ended up selecting C.I know we are referring to a different set of people in Answer Option C but then this a very reason to weaken the author's argument. OA From PS Forum:WeakenX. The correct answer choice is (D)In this stimulus, the author tells us that although city taxes subsidize Greenville public bussing, the buses benefit outside commuters as well, so some city councilors suggest increasing fares to cover the cost of the service. However, some city councillors argue for raising the fares, on the basis that ""taxes should be used primarily to benefit the people who pay them.""The question which follows the stimulus is a Weaken Except question, which means that the four incorrect answer choices will weaken the councillors' argument, and the correct answer choice will not weaken it. The first and most obvious line of attack would be to find and eliminate answers that show that the outside commuters do indeed pay taxes (and indeed several answers play on this approach) or that such a plan would have general negatives that would hurt the city on the whole. In other words, eliminate any answer that hurts the argument of the city councillors, and look for an answer that is irrelevant or strengthens the argument.Answer choice (A): Because businesses in the city are also taxpayers, this answer shows that that raising the fares would hurt a group of taxpayers. In addition, there would be a general loss of benefit to the citizens of the city if businesses left. Thus, this answer choice weakens the argument and is incorrect.Answer choice (B): This answer choice also weakens the argument that fares should be increased, by pointing out another detrimental result associated with the councillors' suggested plan. Thus, this answer choice weakens the argument and is incorrect.Answer choice (C): This answer choice at first appears irrelevant because the low income residents don't pay taxes, and thus one might initially think that this answer is correct. However, the second half of the answer shows that ""all city councilors agree"" that these residents should be able to use the buses without disadvantage. Thus, if adopted, this answer would place the ""some city councillors"" from the stimulus in a contradictory position (as far as their stated goals here for low income residents to take advantage of the services vs the results of their plan which disadvantages low income residents), and that would weaken the argument. This is a very tricky and very well-placed answer (just before the correct answer), evocative of recent Logical Reasoning questions.Answer choice (D): This is the correct answer choice. This choice fails to weaken the argument advanced in the stimulus, because voter preference about increasing local taxes is irrelevant—there is no tax increase even being suggested! The suggestion is to raise bus fares. Additionally, the opinions (""preferences"") in this answer do not attack the facts cited above. Since this answer choice has no effect on the strength of the councillors' argument, this is the correct answer choice to this Weaken Except question.Answer choice (E): This answer choice weakens the argument because it shows that those ""outsiders"" who commute into Greenville do in fact pay taxes to cover the services they use, and thus they would qualify as as people who should benefit from them. Note how carefully the stimulus worded the issues: they never used ""residents,"" they simply used ""people who pay them (taxes)."" This answer then shows that the commuters are actually taxpayers, and consequently the city taxes would be used to benefit those who pay them. As this is the very basis of the councillors' objection to the subsidy, this answer would undermine their objection. I think you are mistaken in saying that “Not Weaken”  =  Strengthen.Not weaken is just that… “not weaken”..it may strengthen the argument, but then it may also be neutral. And that is what option D is doing. Staying neutral..rest all are weakeners.pleonasmAm having a hard time with option DSo the question is asking for strengthening the argument => provide additional premise supporting the fare increase.How is the data provided in D supporting this ? Voters in the city who support low-fares are opposed to taxes ??? So what ? Does this mean because they oppose taxes, to kick their butt the fares have to be increased ?? Not surePosted from my mobile device Fares on the city-run public buses in Greenville are subsidized by city tax revenues, but among the beneficiaries of the low fares are many people who commute from outside the city to jobs in Greenville. Some city councilors argue that city taxes should be used primarily to benefit the people who pay them, and therefore that bus fares should be raised enough to cover the cost of the service.Each of the following, if true, would weaken the argument advanced by the city councilors EXCEPT:(A) Many businesses whose presence in the city is beneficial to the city’s taxpayers would relocate outside the city if public-transit fare were more expensive. - WRONG.(B) By providing commuters with economic incentives to drive to work, higher transit fares would worsen air pollution in Greenville and increase the cost of maintaining the city’s streets. - WRONG.(C) Increasing transit fares would disadvantage those residents of the city whose low incomes make them exempt from city taxes, and all city councilors agree that these residents should be able to take advantage of city-run services. - WRONG. Weakens(D)Votersin the city, many of whom benefit from the low transit fares,are strongly opposedto increasing local taxes. - CORRECT. Voters opinion/intent is not concerned. It's irrelevant as it neither strengthens not weakens the argument. Most importantly who are these voters - taxpayers or non taxpayers, commuters or non-commuters. For this reason this is not good enough a choice that impact the argument.(E) People who work in Greenville and earn wages above the nationally mandated minimum all pay the city wage tax of 5 percent. - WRONG. So they do get some benefit and more is required. But if fares are increased it could have an impact on these people which might lead to a loop in which taxes keep on increasing along with fares.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More TheRzSHi Sunny,E saysout-of-town workers who earn wages above the nationally mandated minimum,DO have to paythe city wage tax of 5 percent. Hence these out-of-towners ARE, in fact, contributing towards thecity tax revenueswhichsubsidized city-run public buses.Since they pay, they are entitled to the benefit.CheersRzSE does not say anything about the out-of-town workers, E just talks about people who work in Greenville.In my opinion, this is a bad question as there is no clear answer.

I chose B for cause and effect.If person is not ill -> person should not get medical checkup.Hence, if medical checkup is done --> person will get ill. IMO B.A) Not all medical tests entail significant discomfort. -OOS(B) Sometimes unnecessary medical tests cause healthy people to become ill.- IMO(C) Some patients refuse to accept a physician’s assurance that the patient is healthy. -OOS(D) The more complete the series of tests performed in a medical checkup, the more likely it is that a rare disease, if present, will be discovered.- this could weaken the argument(E) Physicians can eliminate the need to order certain tests by carefully questioning patients and rejecting some possibilities on that basis.- then patient does not have to decide anything This question is retarded and not an OQ.The basic argument is check ups are bad, so don't get them.B says check ups are bad (they make you sick).Final Answer,B. Since most of users discussing B, D and E then i will address those only (A and C are not correct anyways)B) Sometimes unnecessary medical tests cause healthy people to become ill.Now if one will ask why can the patient not take lot of tests?1.it might be expensive2.it leads to other health issues(list not exhuastive)and this choice properly addresses the second reason that why it will not be reasonable for the patients to have lots of test without feeling ill.(D) The more complete the series of tests performed in a medical checkup, the more likely it is that a rare disease, if present, will be discovered.This condition says that if the disease exist then it can only be discoverd after conplete set of test,but its talking abput 'Rare' disease and which means that the patient is very unlikely to have it so all patients shall not undergo test for rare disease.(E) Physicians can eliminate the need to order certain tests by carefully questioning patients and rejecting some possibilities on that basis.This choice weakens the argument since if the physician can eliminate the possibilty of test then there is no problem at all,since the conclusion will be broken sondensoA physician who is too thorough in conducting a medical checkup is likely to subject the patient to the discomfort and expense of unnecessary tests. One who is not thorough enough is likely to miss some serious problem and therefore give the patient a false sense of security. It is difficult for physicians to judge exactly how thorough they should be. Therefore, it is generally unwise for patients to have medical checkups when they do not feel ill.The argument is:A physican who is too thorough often conducts unnescessary tests to detect any patients' problems.A physican who is NOT too thorough often miss some serious patients' problems.Hence, it is unwise for patients to have medical checkups if they don't feel ill.Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the conclusion in the passage?(A) Not all medical tests entail significant discomfort.If not all medical tests are discomfort, then why dont patients take medical tests? This choice weakens the argument. Eliminated.(B) Sometimes unnecessary medical tests cause healthy people to become ill.Correct. If unnecessary medical tests make false positive result, then it's clear that patients should not take medical checkups because they could become ill and have to take a lot of unnessary medical treatment but in fact they are healthy. This is a serious risk that supports the argument.(C) Some patients refuse to accept a physician’s assurance that the patient is healthy.Then they are willing to take more medical tests. This means choice C weakens the argument.(D) The more complete the series of tests performed in a medical checkup, the more likely it is that a rare disease, if present, will be discovered.This choice also weakens the argument. If taking more tests help patients discover more about their health, then why shouldn't they take complete series of medical tests?(E) Physicians can eliminate the need to order certain tests by carefully questioning patients and rejecting some possibilities on that basis.This choice means that there is no risk for patients to meet physicians and take some medical checks. If there is no risk, then why don't they have medical checkups? Because having medical checkups could help patients make sure that they are healthy or ill.Hence, this choice weakens the argument. Eliminated. HadesThis question is retarded and not an OQ.The basic argument is check ups are bad, so don't get them.B says check ups are bad (they make you sick).Final Answer,B.I also think that this question cannot be an official one. Option b doesn't follow any kind of logic within the argument. Moreover, the premises in the argument itself feel disconnected. giovannisumanoHadesThis question is retarded and not an OQ.The basic argument is check ups are bad, so don't get them.B says check ups are bad (they make you sick).Final Answer,B.I also think that this question cannot be an official one. Option b doesn't follow any kind of logic within the argument. Moreover, the premises in the argument itself feel disconnected.The question asks for the option that would provide themost support, i.e, the best of the lot. It doesn't matter how bad the option is. That said, Option B does not seem all that bad. It does support the point that the passage is trying to make. A physician who is too thorough in conducting a medical checkup is likely to subject the patient to the discomfort and expense of unnecessary tests. One who is not thorough enough is likely to miss some serious problem and therefore give the patient a false sense of security. It is difficult for physicians to judge exactly how thorough they should be. Therefore, it is generally unwise for patients to have medical checkups when they do not feel ill.Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the conclusion in the passage?(A)Not all medical tests entailsignificant discomfort. - WRONG. It's not about all the tests.(B) Sometimes unnecessary medical tests cause healthy people to become ill. - CORRECT. Not the best of the answer one is looking for but best among the choices available here.(C)Some patients refuse to accept a physician’s assurancethat the patient is healthy. - WRONG. Exceptions are always there.(D) The more complete the series of tests performed in a medical checkup, themore likely it is that a rare disease, if present, will be discovered. - WRONG. This most likely does the opposite to the conclusion.(E)Physicians can eliminate the need to order certain testsby carefully questioning patients and rejecting some possibilities on that basis. - WRONG. What a physician should do it does not matter. It's not doing anything to the conclusion as it does not point out how patients are unwise to go for checkups.This question requires a choice that either strengthens the conclusion or does nothing to the passage(but that depends on other choices that most likely weaken the conclusion). Also, this can be an assumption. So, a choice can either a sufficient(strengthener) or an assumption(necessary).Answer B._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More The main idea of this passage is that physicians should not do medical checkups on healthy individuals due to the premise which is aforementioned reasons regarding thoroughness. This is a ""support the argument"" question, so we want to find an answer that gives us more reasons to NOT checkup on people who are not ill. ChoiceBis the only answer choice that does this, so the answer isB. QS: Most support.Argument:1. If too thorough, then discomfort and expense.2  if not thorough enough, then miss some serious problem3. It is difficult to judge thoroughness.4.

Keep it.(C) Some patients refuse to accept a physician’s assurance that the patient is healthy.--> Weakens since it says patients require medical checkups.(D) The more complete the series of tests performed in a medical checkup, the more likely it is that a rare disease, if present, will be discovered.----> Weakens since it shows necessary for medical checkups.(E) Physicians can eliminate the need to order certain tests by carefully questioning patients and rejecting some possibilities on that basis.------> A misleading one.

What if >50% of the women applicants deserved admission ?Hence, the argument assumes ( Defender type ) that no more than half of the applicants who met all the qualifications for admission to the club were women. Answer : DOption A does not provide us with specific information about women applicantsOption B and C talks about a very large set of ALL the roller skaters in Lunnville. The argument is concerned about only the club.Option E talks about people who make decision and is therefore out of scope. Option A says that few applicants only met the qualification criterion .

If the number of women application were more than half and more than the application of man then the argument falls apart as the club discriminated against women. There would be more women than man club had it not discriminated against women.So D is the assumption.

The carpet market is unlike most markets in that consumers are becoming increasingly resistant to new patterns and styles.Source: LSATOFFICIAL EXPLANATIONAs always, the key to success is to isolate the conclusion, which appears in the last sentence: “companies producing carpet will be able to gain market share in the carpet market only through purchasing competitors.” As you should have noted while reading, the conclusion contains a conditional indicator and is thereby conditional in nature. The conclusion can be diagrammed as: GMS = gain market share in the carpet market, PC = purchasing competitors. GMSPC. According to the author, to gain market share in the carpet market a company must purchase a competitor. Answer choice (C) is often selected by students, but it does not attack this idea. To attack a conditional statement you must show that the necessary condition is not actually necessary for the sufficient condition to occur. Answer choice (C) simply suggests that when companies purchase their competitors the endeavor is often financially unsuccessful. Essentially, answer choice (C) fails to prove that purchasing competitors is unnecessary to gain market share. Answer choice (D), on the other hand, does suggest a way for companies to gain market share without purchasing competitors, thereby attacking the conditional statement given in the stimulus.Thus, answer choice (D) is correct.Answer choice (A): This answer goes beyond the scope of the argument, which is limited to the carpet market (and not other floor coverings).Answer choice (B): This is an Opposite answer that strengthens the argument. If there are no remaining niches to fill, then there is no way to expand other than to purchase a competitor.Answer choice (C): This attractive answer is wrong for two very strong reasons: 1. A Shell Game is played with the details of the conclusion. The conclusion is about market share. Answer choice (C) is about a decline in profits and revenues. The two are not the same, and so the information in the answer choice does not weaken the conclusion. 2. Even if you assume that market share is the same thing as profits and revenues, a second Shell Game is played because the answer then attacks a conclusion that is similar but different than the given conclusion. If the conclusion were as follows: PCGMS, then answer choice (C) would be correct (again, assuming market share is the same thing as profits and revenues). But, the above is a Mistaken Reversal of the conclusion, and so the attack is made on a statement that uses the same terms as the conclusion but puts them in a different relationship. This is a great example of the cleverness displayed by the test makers. Fortunately you can avoid this answer if you know what to look for when attacking conditional reasoning. One point worth noting is that it is no accident that the most tempting wrong answer choice appears just before the correct answer.Answer choice (D): This is the correct answer. If price reductions drive out some of the carpet producers, then other producers can take the market share left behind. This scenario shows that a company can gain market share without purchasing a competitor, thus attacking the necessary condition in the conclusion.Answer choice (E): This Opposite answer strengthens the argument. If the consumers are resistant to new styles, then one fewer possibility exists if a company is trying to increase market share. By eliminating this option, the conclusion is strengthened (by eliminating an idea that would hurt the argument, one can strengthen the argument because it has fewer “competitors.”)._________________New to the GMAT Club?• Questions:Question Bank|Bunuel's Signature Collection• Tests:GMAT Club Tests|Forum Quiz• Guides:Quantitative|Verbal|Ultimate Quantitative Collection|All You Need for Quant• Rules:Quantitative|VerbalSignature Read More IMO D.D provides an alternate way for companies to gain market share and hence casts doubt on the argument's conclusion.

Does this warrant the fact that it might recur?? I dont think so, hence, A is ruled out.As for C, most established carpet producers market under several brands. This does not affect the conclusion. To weaken the conclusion we need to say that ""Carpet producing companies can gain a market share NOT through merging, BUT through aggressive marketing.""Option D does exactly that; When other producers are forced to leave the market, there's no room for a merger and dominant firms are reducing prices substantially, which is aggressive marketing.

The conclusion can be diagrammed as: GMS = gain market share in the carpet market, PC = purchasing competitors. GMSPC. According to the author, to gain market share in the carpet market a company must purchase a competitor. Answer choice (C) is often selected by students, but it does not attack this idea. To attack a conditional statement you must show that the necessary condition is not actually necessary for the sufficient condition to occur. Answer choice (C) simply suggests that when companies purchase their competitors the endeavor is often financially unsuccessful. Essentially, answer choice (C) fails to prove that purchasing competitors is unnecessary to gain market share. Answer choice (D), on the other hand, does suggest a way for companies to gain market share without purchasing competitors, thereby attacking the conditional statement given in the stimulus.Thus, answer choice (D) is correct.Answer choice (A): This answer goes beyond the scope of the argument, which is limited to the carpet market (and not other floor coverings).Answer choice (B): This is an Opposite answer that strengthens the argument. If there are no remaining niches to fill, then there is no way to expand other than to purchase a competitor.Answer choice (C): This attractive answer is wrong for two very strong reasons: 1. A Shell Game is played with the details of the conclusion. The conclusion is about market share. Answer choice (C) is about a decline in profits and revenues. The two are not the same, and so the information in the answer choice does not weaken the conclusion. 2.Even if you assume that market share is the same thing as profits and revenues, a second Shell Game is played because the answer then attacks a conclusion that is similar but different than the given conclusion. If the conclusion were as follows: PCGMS, then answer choice (C) would be correct (again, assuming market share is the same thing as profits and revenues). But, the above is a Mistaken Reversal of the conclusion, and so the attack is made on a statement that uses the same terms as the conclusion but puts them in a different relationship.This is a great example of the cleverness displayed by the test makers. Fortunately you can avoid this answer if you know what to look for when attacking conditional reasoning. One point worth noting is that it is no accident that the most tempting wrong answer choice appears just before the correct answer.Answer choice (D): This is the correct answer. If price reductions drive out some of the carpet producers, then other producers can take the market share left behind. This scenario shows that a company can gain market share without purchasing a competitor, thus attacking the necessary condition in the conclusion.Answer choice (E): This Opposite answer strengthens the argument. If the consumers are resistant to new styles, then one fewer possibility exists if a company is trying to increase market share. By eliminating this option, the conclusion is strengthened (by eliminating an idea that would hurt the argument, one can strengthen the argument because it has fewer “competitors.”).Hello,Can any expert explain the bold part in explanation of option C (which is actually referring to option A in the question)? and also why the correct option D is chosen over this option?VeritasKarishmaGMATNinjaMartyTargetTestPrepegmat souvik101990There is relatively little room for growth in the overall carpet market, which is tied to the size of the population.

Here is my take on the options.- People buy carpets only a couple of times in their lives.- So there is little room for growth in carpet markets.Conclusion: As population ages (fewer babies), to increase market share, companies will need to buy out competitors. Marketing will not help to increase market share.So the conclusion says that since carpet market is not growing, the only way a company can have higher market share is by reducing the number of players in the market by buying out other companies. They cannot hope to attract new customers or customers away from other companies by marketing.We need to weaken this conclusion.A. Two of the three mergers in the industry’s last ten years led to a decline in profits and revenues for the newly merged companies.Irrelevant. We are concerned only about market share (out of the total sales in the industry, what % belongs to a particular company)B. Most of the major carpet producers market other floor coverings as well.Irrelevant. Only carpets are within our scope.C. Most established carpet producers market several different brand names and varieties, and there is no remaining niche in the market for new brands to fill.This tells us that the market is maxed out. No new players can be successful since there is no space for them. So marketing will not be helpful. If one buys out another player, then yes, they will own all their brands and hence, increase their market share. This certainly does not weaken our conclusion. It seems to agree with our conclusion.D. Price reductions, achieved by cost-cutting in production, by some of the dominant firms in the carpet market are causing other producers to leave the market altogether.Some players are leaving the market since they cannot give competitive pricing. So the number of players in the market are expected to reduce. Then marketing campaigns might be successful in getting higher market shares since there are going to be fewer players. Also it seems that marketing campaigns of price reductions are leading to higher market shares by driving out competitors. Then it may not be necessary to buy out other companies to increase market share.  It weakens our conclusion.E. The carpet market is unlike most markets in that consumers are becoming increasingly resistant to new patterns and styles.This supports that marketing campaigns may not have much impact. It doesn't weaken our conclusion.Answer (D)_________________-FULL & FREE Access to all ANA PREP content on 29th Nov, 30th Nov and 1st Dec atanaprep.comYouTube Channel:karishma.anaprepSignature Read More In the official answer, i think the answers may be switched around.In the official explanation, C is referring to A, and A is referring to C.Posted from my mobile device There is relatively little room for growth in the overall carpet market, which is tied to the size of the population. Most who purchase carpet do so only once or twice, first in their twenties or thirties, and then perhaps again in their fifties or sixties. Thus as the population ages, companies producing carpet will be able to gain market share in the carpet market only through purchasing competitors, and not through more aggressive marketing.Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the conclusion above?A. Two of the three mergers in the industry’s last ten years led to a decline in profits and revenues for the newly merged companies. - WRONG. Past is irrelevant. Additionally, nothing about market share.B. Most of the major carpet producers market other floor coverings as well. - WRONG. Scope shift. Irrelevant.C. Most established carpet producers market several different brand names and varieties, and there is no remaining niche in the market for new brands to fill. - WRONG. Having no niche is a disaster for new carpet makers. With already blue market turning red, acquiring seems to be the only way to increase the share.D. Price reductions, achieved by cost-cutting in production, by some of the dominant firms in the carpet market are causing other producers to leave the market altogether. - CORRECT. If producers are leaving then that share of market are easy to be captured by those not leaving. This leaves us with another way of increasing the market share instead of just acquiring a competitors.E. The carpet market is unlike most markets in thatconsumers are becoming increasingly resistant to new patterns and styles. - WRONG. New Patterns, whether by old established players or new ones, aren't liked by consumers so increasing market shares is possible by acquiring competitors. As new players may like to bring new patterns wherein old ones may stick to old patterns since they know it well, acquiring seems to be a good idea to increase share.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More KarishmaBin choice E, the factt hat customers are resistant to new styles, doesnt it weaken the conclusion since buying competitors will not make sense any more as consumers are resistant to new stylesMartyMurrayGMATNinja Elite097in choice E, the factt hat customers are resistant to new styles, doesnt it weaken the conclusion since buying competitors will not make sense any more as consumers are resistant to new stylesIn a sense, buying a competitor involves taking over the competitor's business.The competitor's business involves selling carpet.

In other words, we're likely to think that the only reason someone would dismiss something out of hand is because its a crappy idea (""weaknesses are more pronounced than strong points"").

As mentioned, decision makers are presenting their views (which they may not really believe in) to get others’ reaction. It’s not written that whichever idea they present before others is the one that finally gets implemented.It may or may not be. The option justexpresses a possibility(...could nonetheless...); it’s not saying for sure thattheidea presented is actuallytheidea implemented.(B) Certain decision makers do not know which ideas they do not really believe in until after they have presented a variety of ideas to their advisers. ---> We cannot say this after reading the excerpt.We might say that decision makers at least know what they believe in. Decision makers are just trying to know whether the idea that they vouch for is totally different from others or not.@ ritula: Though it’s mentioned that they take input from advisors,it’s also mentioned that they put forth their ideas to advisors(last sentence of excerpt: ...independently by their advisers) to get their reactions in order to know whether their (decision makers) views are idiosyncratic or not.(C) If certain decision makers dismiss an idea out of hand, it must be because its weaknesses are more pronounced than any strong points it may have. ---> Though, the second part may be right, the first part is wrong. Decision makers arenot dismissing any idea out of hand; everything goes through adiscussion process. Hence, discard it.(D) Certain decision makers proceed in a way that makes it likely that they will frequently decide in favor of ideas in which they do not believe. ---> This is not mentioned/suggested anywhere in the excerpt. They may take up an idea in which they do not believe in just to get others’ viewpoint butthis does not mean that they will likely decide in favour of such ideas.(E) If certain decision makers’ advisers know the actual beliefs of those they advise, those advisers will give better advice than they would if they did not know those beliefs. ---> This is not mentioned/suggested anywhere in the excerpt. Red Herring.--------------------------My choice is optionA. Good question. +1.Hope that helps.Regards,Technext I chose A.B - decision makers do believe in ideas, but they want to explore whether it is idiosyncratic with advisers.C - decision makers do not dismiss idea plainly on the basis of pronounced weaknesses. They discuss in detail with advisors before taking decision.D - This may be true. But, not always true.E - not really. man I chose A too, but it was because the other ones felt a bit off nothing to distinct.  Whats OA I chose A but not felt confident of my choice but nothing seemed relevant than Aif the decisionmakers dicuss the ideas which they dont't actually believe in just to see how know his advisers stancethen obviouslythe decision makers quotes will be differ from the actual decisionthis was emphasised in the statement A.so my choice is A One more point, in this question you would want to find out an answer that is ""necessarily"" true and totally airtight, and not an answer that could/might be true because the genre of the question is ""Must be true"". All other possibilities apart from A are questionable as Tommy Wallach has pointed out, and A is the only one that can always be inferred absolutely.Regards,Subhash Hmm. Interesting question. Appears difficult, but not as tricky as some other 700+ level GMAT questions. Let's give this one ago. Before we get into the business of finding out the correct answer, lets analyse the question type to understand what we need to be looking for .Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the statement above? [/i]""Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the statement above?"" The answer to the questions which have the question stem...most strongly supported.."", must be 10000000% true. The GMAT definition of the ""conclusion"" kind of questions is that the conclusion must be able to withstand even the slightest scrutiny.So let's put on on our weatherman hat.Any weatherman who goes live national TV to say  ""Itcouldrain tonight"", canneverbe sued for making intentionally  false statements.. When the weatherman uses the words ""could rain"", he implies that here is a possibility of  rain. Of-course, if the weatherman were to say, Itwillrain tonight, now that's a whole different story.Let's understand that such a stringent requirement implies that the answer  would most probably contain words such as ""could, possibly"" etc.  [/color]. Let's get back to the question.Decision makers tend to have distinctive styles. One such style is for the decision maker to seek the widest possible input from advisers and to explore alternatives while making up his or her mind. In fact, decision mak-ers of this sort will often argue vigorously for a particular idea, emphasizing its strong points and downplaying its weaknesses, not because they actually believe in the idea but because they want to see if their real reserva-tions about it are idiosyncratic or are held independently by their advisers.(A) If certain decision makers’ statements are quoted accurately and at length, the content of the quote could nonetheless be greatly at variance with the decision eventually make.  -:Let's come to this one at the end.(B) Certain decision makers do not know which ideas they do not really believe in until after they have presented a variety of ideas to their advisersThis statement MAY be true in real world. But remember, we are in GMAT LA LA land, where the grass is always yellow and the answer stem has to  be directly inferred from the question.. The passage makes an argument about how""certain decision makers""like to take an opposite stand about an argument only to hear what others have to say. This answer (B)  is too generic and talks about other kinds of decision makers.(C) If certain decision makers dismiss an idea out of hand, it must be because its weaknesses are more pro-nounced than any strong points it may have.There is no mention in the passage aboutwhat makes a decision maker reject an idea out of hand.The passage merely talks about how certain decision maker arrive at a decision by taking an opposite stand.(D) Certain decision makers proceed in a way that makes it likely that they will frequently decide in favor of ideas in which they do not believe.Again, this answer may be true in real life, but this answer definitelycannot be inferred from the passage in the question stem,. No sane decision maker will ever decide in favor of ideas in which they do not believe(E) If certain decision makers’ advisers know the actual beliefs of those they advise, those advisers will give better advice than they would if they did not know those beliefs.All the passage says is that certain decision makers take an opposite stand. There is no mention about how and why the advisers react the way they do.Ok, lets go back to (A)If certain decision makers’ statements are quoted accurately and at length, the content of the quote could nonetheless be greatly at variance with the decision eventually make.Note the use of the word ""could"". This is a positive sign. One cannot really argue against arguments that use the word such as ""could"", ""may"", ""possibly:.  This answer stem (A) is a restatement of the passage that ,[i]Certain decision makers take opposite positions about an argument.So if one were to record the initial statements of the decision makers  and then compare these initial statements with the final decision, it is very possible that the initial statements could be at odds with the final decisionVOILA ! should one expect to see a question like this in the gmat exam??",https://gmatclub.com/forum/decision-makers-tend-to-have-distinctive-styles-one-such-style-76077.html

"In a learning experiment a researcher ran rats through a maze. Some of the rats were blind, others deaf, others lacked a sense of smell, and others had no sensory deficiencies; yet all the rats learned the task in much the same amount of time.

Something not being irrelevant doesn't make it sufficient. If you have a buddy who can never wake up on time, what is sufficient for his waking up? 1. His alarm clock goes off. 2. He isn't hungover or exhausted from playing video games all night. 3. He doesn't just ignore the alarm clock. We'd say his alarm clock actually going off is not irrelevant to his getting up--it may be necessary--but that doesn't make it sufficient. All sorts of other things have to happen for him to wake up.The same thing is true here. (B) captures the difference between kinesthesia being possibly necessary versus it's being sufficient. Even if the mice need it for maze-learning, maybe they need something else, too. The experiment doesn't give us enough to know what else is required.(A) is irrelevant.(C) is also irrelevant. We aren't concerned with how it takes place.(D) is wrong because it's actually not determined by the study that rats can maze-learn by kinesthesia alone. And the rest of (D) is irrelevant.(E) is tricky. It takes the lack of knowledge that kinesthesia is sufficient and turns it into knowledge that kinesthesia is insufficient. We don't know whether kinesthesia is sufficient or not. (E) tells us that we do. Can someone explain the difference between B and E?Tx, Srinjoy. srinjoy1990Can someone explain the difference between B and E?Tx, Srinjoy.E goes against the premise that kinesthesia, the sensation of bodily movement, is sufficient for maze-learning. the data doesn't suggest that additional sources are required it tells us that we can't rule out the possibility that kinesthesia combibed with such sources yields the results obtained. srinjoy1990Can someone explain the difference between B and E?Tx, Srinjoy.Choice B is the correct answer as it shows that kinesthesia is not sufficient for maze learning. Maze learning requires some other sense with kinesthesia.E It can be determined from the data that maze-learning in rats depends on at least two sources of sensory stimulation, one of which is kinesthesia, but which of the remaining sources must also be employed is not determinable.E is very tricky statement. This statement mentions that maze learning depends on at least two senses. This takes it for granted that there are more than two sensory inputs.

How many of the other senses are used, it doesn't say.Regards,Arup Sarkar hello Karishma,I read your post but still have a question.As you said ""The argument concludes that kinesthesia alone is sufficient. But it doesn't consider that kinesthesia along with one (or two) other sense might be performing well together"",if kinesthesia+another sense (let's say hearing) should be together for maze-learning---->that means the hearing is a necessary factor for learning, then how can the deaf rats perform as well as other rats who are not deaf? I don't think these two groups (deaf VS not deaf) can use the same amount time to learn maze From Powerscore:This stimulus describes an experiment that uses rats with and without different deficiencies in sight, hearing, and smell. The rats with the deficiencies lacked one of these senses. The experiment found that the rats with the deficiencies completed the experiment in the same amount of time as those without. It then describes another sense—kinesthesia—which may have an effect on the experiment. The argument concludes that given the evidence, kinesthesia is by itself sufficient to allow the rats with the deficiencies to complete the experiments. The flaw here is that the experiment is set up improperly. The rats with the deficiencies did not complete the experiment using kinesthesia alone; rather, they also had the aid of senses other than those in which they were deficient. Therefore, it is possible that these rats did not rely on kinesthesia alone in completing the experiment.Answer choice (A) The small differences in proficiency are irrelevant to the argument. The fact that the rats completed the experiment in much the same time simply shows that the rats with deficiencies are somehow as proficient in completing the experiment as those without.Answer choice (B): This is the correct answer choice. The evidence does not exclude the possibility that the rats also used their non-deficient senses in addition to kinesthesia to complete the experiment. The argument, however, jumps to the conclusion that kinesthesia alone is sufficient to complete the experiment.Answer choice (C) In order for the argument to be valid, it need not show how the rats relied on kinesthesia.Answer choice (D) There are two problems with this answer. First, as explained above, it is not clear from the evidence presented that the rats can complete the experiment using kinesthesia alone. Second, the possibility that rats respond to non-kinesthetic stimulation need not be ruled out, as the argument does not address non-kinesthetic stimulation.Answer choice (E) The first part of this answer choice is true, as our pre-phrase shows. However, regarding the second part, the argument need not determine which remaining source must also be employed. The trap of Option E is as follows:It takes for granted or brings in new information that cannot be directly determined/logically concluded from the data already given in the argument.Does that mean that we cannot bring in new information? No, certainly, we can, but for that question stem has to clearly mention it ,eg: which of the following,if true, most weakens the argument?If the question had clearly stated ''if true'' than I could have taken that new information for granted and marked the Option E.Hope the logic is clear, so next time, whenever we see the strengthen or weaken question , check if the question stem mentions ''if true'' ,then we can take any new information for granted , not otherwise.This is my understanding, I would like to have the expert opinion on this matter.RegardsVighnesh Answer BKinesthesia (sensation of bodily movement) is important, but each rat had some other sensory also at the same time.For example - A blind rat may have a proper smell, hearing sensory etc along with Kinesthesia.So, we can’t assume that Kinesthesia alone is sufficient for maze running.It may require the help of one or more sensory organs - which is not yet verified or checked in the experiment by researchers. Hence, option B is the correct answer choice.

The channels were cut by water, but we do not know whether the channels were cut by slow moving water or floods. Not Sufficient.(B) The Guiches is known to be similar in certain respects to many other volcanic rock formations. - Incorrect. Irrelevant.(C) More than one glacier was present in the area during prehistoric times. - Incorrect. Irrelevant.(D) Volcanic rock is more easily cut by water than are other forms of rock. - Incorrect. We cannot explain the acceptance of flood theory based on this fact.(E) Scientists now believe that the prehistoric glacier dammed a source of water, created a huge lake in the process, and then retreated. - Correct.Answer: E is the answer E? other options doesn't seem convincing.... Option E fits the bill !it clearly supports the flood theory but doesn't reveal how glacier melted. broallThe Gulches is an area of volcanic rock that is gashed by many channels that lead downhill from the site of a prehistoric glacier to a river.

But one geologist theorized that the channels were cut in a short time by an enormous flood.

Paradoxically, today the scientific community accepts the flood theory even though scientists still do not know of a process that can melt so much ice so quickly.Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the passage?(A) Rippies, which indicate that the channels were cut by water, have been discovered in the floors of the channels.(B) The Guiches is known to be similar in certain respects to many other volcanic rock formations.(C) More than one glacier was present in the area during prehistoric times.(D) Volcanic rock is more easily cut by water than are other forms of rock.(E) Scientists now believe that the prehistoric glacier dammed a source of water, created a huge lake in the process, and then retreated.A) scientists used to not believe in the flood theory, because they didn't know how ice could melt so quickly (so as to flow down the rock so fast)(B) scientists now believe in flood theory, even though they still don't know of a scientific process that can make ice melt so quickly.We need an answer that helps explain why this might be.The reason that (E) is correct is because it gives evidence to the point that the flood did occur. So, even if the scientists haven't figured out that one thing (how ice melted so quickly), it's still likely that the flood did occur and cause the ripples.Take for example the following argument:It used to be that people believed the sun revolved around the earth, and one reason was that no one had gone to the sun.It is now believed that the earth revolves around the sun, even though no one has yet to go to the sun.Notice this analogy shares a common trait with our original argument:The evidence used before has still not been resolved, but that doesn't mean the opinion can't be changed.(D) does not resolve the paradox because the paradox does not involve a comparison of one type of rock to another.(C)  it didn't say that these glaciers were on top of this mountain. It just said that they were ""in the area"". So the fact that there are more glaciers is irrelevant. First, in all the resolve the paradox type questions, the goal is to identify the 2 ideas or facts that seem to be in contradiction.For a long time scientists accepted that the cutting of the channels by the water occurred gradually as the glacier melted.Then, at first, most rejected the hypothesis that the channels were quickly created by a flood because no one knew of any process that could melt so much ice so quickly.However, in apparent contradiction to this second fact, most people NOW accept this quick flood theory even though scientists still do not know of any natural process that could melt ice that quickly.Why is it that NOW scientists accept the flood theory, even thought they still have not determined a natural process that explains  how the ice could have melted so quickly?  Nothing has changed really in this regard from when they first rejected the theory. So why the sudden change of heart now?A lot of the resolve the paradox questions revolve around determining an alternative explanation for the facts:  something that would tell us how the scientists could believe the channels were created quickly by a flood, even though the ice could not have melted quick enough via a natural process to create such a flood (in their eyes).-A-  We don’t really get any new info. from answer A. We already know that water was the cause of the creation of the channels. All the Rippies do is show further evidence of a fact we already know.We need to answer why it is scientists now believe that the channels were created quickly by a flood when there is STILL no natural process that could melt ice quick enough to create such a flood.Eliminate A-B-  All this answer tell us is that the rock is similar to other volcanic rock. We don’t have anything from the passage to help connect this fact to anything meaningful. Just because the rock is similar to other volcanic rocks, why do the scientists now believe in the flood theory? Nothing is resolved by the fact from answer BEliminate B-C-  “More then one glacier was present...”To me, this answer seemed like the “runner-up.”  One could think that this new fact shows us that there was more than one glacier that could have melted. Perhaps TWO glaciers melting would explain how the flood theory could be the explanation for the creation of the channels.However, just because there was one more glacier, the fact still stands that the scientists do not know of any natural process that could melt the ice quick enough. Are 2 glaciers enough for the scientists to reconsider this position?  We just don’t know.The fact stands that the scientists still do not  know of any natural process that could have melted the ice so quickly such that the flood theory could be explained. This was their reason for rejecting the flood theory in the first place.  Why did they change their mind and now accept the theory, even though no new natural processes were discovered? We just don’t know.Eliminate C-D-  Just because this volcanic rock is cut more easily by water than is other types of rock, we still don’t know why the scientists changed the their mind and now accept the flood theory.Eliminate D-E- Offers an alternative explanation for why the scientists now accept the theory, even though a natural process that could have melted the ice quickly has not been discovered. All the facts remain true and the apparent contradiction is resolved.What this answer offers is another pathway or method via which the water could have flooded the rock quick enough to create the channels. If the glacier dammed off a huge source of water, then it is possible that this water built up considerably over the years.  If this dam broke at one point, then we would have our quick acting flood that could create the channels.Note:  the scientists still do not know of any natural processes that could melt ice that quickly. However, because of this discovery of a possible dam, we have an explanation about why they changed their mind about the flood theory.  This new fact offers a reason that helps explain why the scientists changed their mind about the flood theory.(E)Posted from my mobile device Question stem: Solve The paradox.Argument:Prehistoric glaciers joined the river by many channels.The channels were cut by running water.First theory: the cutting occurred gradually, as the glacier melted.Second theory: the channels were cut in a short time by an enormous flood.The channels do show physical evidence of having been formed quickly, but the flood theory was originally rejected because scientists knew of no natural process that could melt so much ice so quickly.Paradox: today the scientific community accepts the second theory(A) Rippies, which indicate that the channels were cut by water, have been discovered in the floors of the channels.---> We already knew channels were cut by water. So What? OUT.(B) The Guiches is known to be similar in certain respects to many other volcanic rock formations. ---> The Guiches = other volcanic rock? So what? OUT.(C) More than one glacier was present in the area during prehistoric times.---> Come on, who cares of the number of the glaciers? OUT.(D) Volcanic rock is more easily cut by water than are other forms of rock.--> volcanic rock > other rock in cut with water. So what? OUT.(E) Scientists now believe that the prehistoric glacier dammed a source of water, created a huge lake in the process, and then retreated. ---> This is a evidence for Flood theory. So E is correct.",https://gmatclub.com/forum/the-gulches-is-an-area-of-volcanic-rock-that-is-gashed-by-many-channel-250931.html
"Advertisement: Attention pond owners! Ninety-eight percent of mosquito larvae in a pond die within minutes after the pond has been treated with BTI. Yet BTI is not toxic to fish, birds, animals, plants, or beneficial insects.

All we are concerned(majorly) with is the population of the insect.Comparing ""A"" and ""E"", in my reckoning, ""A"" is a more valid and solid assumption.Please point out the flaw in the reasoningOption A is not an assumption here. It can be the MOST effective way to destroy mosquitoes or the LEAST effective way or just a GOOD way. Argument does not depend on this. An assumption is a must be true option to hold the conclusion true.The most effective way to control the numbers of mosquitoes in a given area is to destroy the mosquito larvae in that area.To destroy mosquito larvae it need not to be the most effective. There might be other effective ways but we are not concerned with those. They are out of scope. If the current plane is effective then it is enough for us.So, see that it is not a must be true and hence not an assumption. we need to find an answer that would connect two pieces: 1) Bti destroyes mosquitto 2) fish stays aliveE does the job, because of the wish to be dependent of mosquitos->then BTI would affect fish as well Advertisement: Attention pond owners!

Here is the argument core:BTI kills mosquito larvae.BTI doesn't kill other species.Therefore by using BTI, you can kill mosquito larvae without affecting/killing other species.The assumption gap is clearly one that is needed to bridge the link between the larvae and other species. If there is a way for mosquito larvae to impact other species, then that would be a problem to the argument. Hence, E. The conclusion of the argument is that the population of mosquitoes can be greatly reduced using method Xwithout damagingthe population of fish, frogs, or some good insects.The correct answer must address the ""without damaging"" part. Otherwise, the whole argument will fall apart.Option Aonly talks about the effectiveness of method X. It does not touch on the main point of the conclusion, i.e. will other species be affected if method X is used to kill mosquitoes?So,option Eis by far the best option.

It may be the most effective way but there is no underlying assumption saying so(B) Populations of mosquitoes are not dependent on a single body of water within an area as a place foe their larvae to hatch and developI almost picked this one.

D is ok as long as minors were not employed._________________GMAT loosers are born not made !!!Signature Read More I see considerable issue with A.Even though the mortality rate is below pre-famine rate, the famine must have reduced the population.I.e pre famine there were 1000 people, of which 100 were dying.Mortality rate being 10%Post famine, there are 500 people, of which 10 are dying.Mortality rate being 2%.But even then, the the number of able-bodied man may have gone down. Mortality rate itself doesn't say anything.Pls explain.Posted from my mobile device Choice (B), in my understanding, says that eviction policies drove away the population that couldn't work and kept many of able-bodied workers??? <= so after the famine, labor supply  would actually DECREASE. This does not contribute to the explanation of the generalization. exc4liburChoice (B), in my understanding, says that eviction policies drove away the population that couldn't work and kept many of able-bodied workers??? <= so after the famine, labor supply  would actually DECREASE. This does not contribute to the explanation of the generalization.We are trying to explain why wages did not increase despite the population decreasingin Ireland, during the decade following the potato famine.(B) tells us that eviction policies forced the elderly and infirm to emigrate, while a high percentage of able bodied workers remained in Ireland. So even though theoverallpopulation decreased, the labor supply did NOT decrease that much in comparison. The supply of labor was not heavily impacted by emigration, which provides one explanation for stagnant wages in Ireland in the decade following the famine.Because (E) contributes to the explanation, it is not the correct answer.I hope that helps!_________________GMAT/GRE/EA tutors@www.gmatninja.com(hiring!) |YouTube|Articles|IGBeginners' Guides:RC|CR|SC|Complete Resource Compilations:RC|CR|SCYouTube LIVE webinars:all videos by topic+24-hour marathon for UkraineQuestion Explanation Collections:RC|CR|SCSignature Read More One of the possible reasons for wages not increasing would be if the workforce does not diminish in numbers and hence no supply shortage occurs in the first place.Let's look at the options.(A) Improved medical care reduced the mortality rate among able-bodied adults in the decade following the famine to below prefamine levels.-- This supports the premise of the workforce not reducing post famine. Strong support for low/consistent wages(B) Eviction policies of the landowners in Ireland were designed to force emigration of the elderly and infirm, who could not work, and to retain a high percentage of able-bodied workers.-- This supports the premise of the workforce not having other livelihood or civil struggles such as those faced by others. Strong support for low/consistent wages(C) Advances in technology increased the efficiency of industry and agriculture, and so allowed maintenance of economic output with less demand for labor.-- Changes the dynamics and fulfils less workforce supply with technology. Strong support for low/consistent wages(D) The birth rate increased during the decade following the famine, and this compensated for much of the loss of population that was due to the famine.-- Increased birth rate post famine would only increase population in the lower age group that does not participate in the workforce. Hence this would probably not contribute to the argument.(E) England, which had political control of Ireland, legislated artificially low wages to provide English-owned industry and agriculture in Ireland with cheap labor.-- Strong support for low/consistent wagesOption D Throughout European history famines have generally been followed by period of rising wages, because when a labor force is diminished, workers are more valuable in accordance with the law of supply and demand. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s is an exception; it resulted in the death or emigration of half of Ireland's population, but there was no significant rise in the average wages in Ireland in the following decade.Which one of the following, if true, would LEAST contribute to an explanation of the exception to the generalization?(A) Improved medical carereduced the mortality rate among able-bodied adultsin the decade following the famine to below prefamine levels. - WRONG. So, relatively more people were available to work. Explains the reason of low wages.(B) Eviction policies of the landowners in Ireland were designed toforce emigration of the elderly and infirm, who could not work, and toretain a high percentage of able-bodied workers. - WRONG. Again explains so wrong.(C) Advances in technologyincreased the efficiency of industry and agriculture, and so allowed maintenance of economic output withless demand for labor. - WRONG. Two factor highlighted help explain the reason for low wages.(D) Thebirth rate increased during the decadefollowing the famine, and thiscompensated for much of the loss of populationthat was due to the famine. - CORRECT. If so, then it is not necessary that people were of working age. Least helps explain.(E) England, which had political control of Ireland,legislated artificially low wagesto provide English-owned industry and agriculture in Ireland with cheap labor.	- WRONG. So, suppressed wages were because of a legislation. Helps explain thus wrong.Answer D._________________Pain + Reflection = Progress | Ray DalioGood Books to read prior to MBASignature Read More",https://gmatclub.com/forum/throughout-european-history-famines-have-generally-been-followed-250932.html
"When the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of return on the most profitable investment available, the difference between those two rates will be the percentage by which, at a minimum, the value of any investment will decline.

A and D can be true, but they are not MUST.If the decline is more than the formula that is given, then the investment in question is other than the most profitable one, because for the most profitable investment the decline will me minimum. OA is CThis is how i approached the problem. I was looking for an external factor that would have caused the effect mentioned.(decline in the value of Investment)A) the rate of inflation has risen -Already given in the stemB) the investment in question is becoming lessprofitable- Out of scopeC) the investment in question is less profitable than the most profitable investment available -ContenderD) the rate of return on the most profitable investment available has declined -Already given in the stemE) there has been a change in which particular investment happens to be the most profitable available -ContenderWas stuck between C and E. It should not be E....I too got really confused and took some time to get it right between C and E.A minor conclusion that can also be drawn from the stimuli is that, if somebody, invests in an instrument other than the most profitable investment, he is bound to get a higher negative return....This excludes option E. B and C are in a way similar but B is very vague. (becoming less profitable).The argument is based on two aspects - Rate of inflation & most profitable investment.When in doubt... i always try to rally around the key words given in the stem.Hope this helps. Its C.The questions says thatP  (loss)     =       Inflation percent    - profit onmost profitable investmentIf a particular investment got a greater loss then it means that its not as profitable as most profitbaleTo explain in numbersinvestment made - 100Inflation percent be 5%Profit on most profitable be 3%so the real value of investment should 105 but is only 103 and p is 2%so if a particular investment has loss greater p that means that it is less profitable since the inflations stays the same for all investments...... This one is real toughie between B and CB says the businesss is less proffitable which is correct. To make the investment go below the minimum percentage either the cost or the revenue has to decrease. Either way both will result in the profitibility of the business.C is also kind of correct. Had it been 'the investment in question is less profitable than the most profitable investment availabletheortically' it would have made more sense because practically it might happen that all businesses have failed to at much deeper level than the business at hand.So the business we are talking about perhaps becomes the most proffitable of all. Was stuck between B and C.. Thanks sniper your POE is really helpful to arrive at the right answer.. We can't bring new info to the argument. So, only A and C left.Confused b/w A and C, as it is given that when the rate of inflation exceeds (not has exceeded - crucial point). Due to this I marked A.It is my fault no to read the argument carefully that we are given two types of investments:most profitableandany.Thanks snippertrader for the post. manojgmatI chose B, why B cannot be answer?There are TWO investments posited in the question. The first is ""the most profitable investment"". The second is ""a particular investment"". The second is also the investment under investigation.B cannot be the answer because B assumes that the ""particular investment"" IS ""the most profitable investment"", but nothing in the question explicitly states that they are the same.

The second is also the investment under investigation.B cannot be the answer because B assumes that the ""particular investment"" IS ""the most profitable investment"", but nothing in the question explicitly states that they are the same.Also, B cannot be right because a particular investment can become more profitable but still decline more than ""that percentage"", which is the difference between inflation rate the the ROI of the MOST profitable investment.

If in such a circumstance the value of a particular investment declines by more than that percentage, it must be true that:the most important phrase in the stem is ""most profitable"", the base of the %term in question is the comparison b/w inflation and the most profitable. so anything that is more than this % have to be compared to the ""most profitable"".C is the only choice providing the specific base of comparison ""most profitable"", Most profitable investment will have a profitability decline %.if the profitability decline % is more for the investment in question,its obvious that the profitability of the investment will be lesser than the most profitable investment.Hence C comes out clean in this. was stuck between B and C. felt inclined to choose C but picked B as it seemed correct.ruled out E as it seems out of scope/unclear as the ""change"": whatever that is - it is not mentioned. snipertraderWhen the rate of inflation exceeds the rate of return on the most profitable investment available, the difference between those two rates will be the percentage by which, at a minimum, the value of any investment will decline.
