        "background": "Before the printing press, books could be purchased only in expensive manuscript copies. The printing press produced books that were significantly less expensive than the manuscript editions. The public's demand for printed books in the first years after the invention of the printing press was many times greater than demand had been for manuscript copies. This increase demonstrates that there was a dramatic jump in the number of people who learned how to read in the years after publishers first started producing books on the printing press.",
        "question": "Which one of the following statements, if true, casts doubt on the argument? A. During the first years after the invention of the printing press, letter writing by people who wrote without the assistance of scribes or clerks exhibited a dramatic increase. B. Books produced on the printing press are often found with written comments in the margins in the handwriting of the people who owned the books. C. In the first years after the printing press was invented, printed books were purchased primarily by people who had always bought and read expensive manuscripts but could afford a greater number of printed books for the same money. D. Books that were printed on the printing press in the first years after its invention often circulated among friends in informal reading clubs or libraries. E. The first printed books published after the invention of the printing press would have been useless to illiterate people, since the books had virtually no illustrations.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because it indicates that the increase in demand for printed books was not due to an increase in literacy, but rather that the same literate individuals who previously bought expensive manuscripts were now able to purchase more printed books for the same amount of money. A. This is incorrect because it suggests an increase in literacy-related activities, which supports the argument. B. This is incorrect as it does not provide relevant information to weaken the argument. D. This is incorrect because it suggests that books were being shared, which could imply an increase in readership. E. This is incorrect because it does not address the argument directly; it merely states that illiterate people would not buy the books, which does not weaken the conclusion about those who could read. Therefore, the answer is C."

For that reason, Bevex is in fact safe for people.",
        "question": "In order for the conclusion that Bevex is safe for people to be properly drawn, which of the following must be true? A. Cancer from carcinogenic substances develops more slowly in mice than it does in people. B. If all food additives that are currently used in foods were tested, some would be found to be carcinogenic for mice. C. People drink fewer than 25 cans of Bevex-sweetened soda per day. D. People can obtain important health benefits by controlling their weight through the use of artificially sweetened soft drinks. E. Some of the studies done on Bevex were not relevant to the question of whether or not Bevex is carcinogenic for people.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because the conclusion that Bevex is safe for people relies on the assumption that people do not consume more than 25 cans of Bevex-sweetened drinks per day. If people drink fewer than 25 cans, then the studies indicating carcinogenic effects in mice are not applicable to human consumption. A. This is incorrect because it does not address the consumption levels of Bevex in humans. B. This is incorrect because it discusses other food additives and does not relate to the safety of Bevex specifically. D. This is incorrect because it introduces a health benefit that is irrelevant to the argument about safety. E. This is incorrect because it questions the relevance of studies, which does not strengthen the conclusion about Bevex's safety. Therefore, the Answer is C."

        "question": "Because of this impossibility there can be no moral duty to choose products in the way these environmentalists urge, since ___________. Which one of the following principles provides the most appropriate completion for the argument? A. a moral duty to perform an action is never based solely on the effects the action will have on other people B. a person cannot possibly have a moral duty to do what he or she is unable to do C. moral considerations should not be the sole determinants of what products are made available to consumers D. the morally right action is always the one whose effects produce the least total harm E. where a moral duty exists, it supersedes any legal duty and any other kind of duty",
        "answer": "B. This is correct because the argument states that consumers cannot assess the environmental impact of products, which means they cannot have a moral duty to choose products based on that impact. Therefore, a person cannot possibly have a moral duty to do what he or she is unable to do. A is incorrect because it discusses effects on other people, which is not relevant to the environmental impact. C is incorrect as it shifts focus away from the moral duty of consumers. D is incorrect because it does not address the inability to assess environmental impact. E is irrelevant as it compares moral duties to legal duties, which is not the focus of the argument."

In preceding elections the Land Party made no attempt to address the interests of economically distressed urban groups. B. Voters are more likely to vote for a political party that focuses on their problems. C. The Land Party had most of its successes when there was economic distress in the agricultural sector. D. No other major party in Banestria specifically addressed the issues of people who lived in semirural areas in 1935. E. The greater the degree of economic distress someone is in, the more likely that person is to vote.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is A. This is correct because option A discusses the Land Party's previous elections and their lack of focus on urban groups, which is irrelevant to the argument about their success in 1935. It does not strengthen or weaken the argument regarding the Land Party's targeting of rural and semirural voters during that specific election. B strengthens the argument because it supports the idea that voters respond positively to parties that address their issues. C strengthens the argument by showing a pattern of success linked to economic distress in agriculture. D strengthens the argument by indicating that the Land Party was the only major party addressing the concerns of semirural voters, likely increasing their support. E also strengthens the argument by suggesting that distressed voters are more likely to vote, which aligns with the Land Party's targeting strategy."

The argument assumes that a correlation between two phenomena is evidence that one is the cause of the other. D. The argument draws a general conclusion about a group based on data about an unrepresentative sample of that group. E. The argument infers that a property belonging to large institutions belongs to all institutions.",

This is correct because the argument relies on the testimony of computer experts, whose expertise is not shown to be sufficiently broad to support the general claim about the highest priority for hospital executives. The testimony of these experts does not necessarily translate to a comprehensive understanding of the specific needs and priorities of hospitals. A is incorrect because the argument does not confuse causes with solutions; it simply presents a conclusion based on expert testimony. C is incorrect as there is no correlation or causation implied in the argument. D is incorrect because the argument does not draw a conclusion based on an unrepresentative sample; it simply relies on the claims of the experts. E is incorrect as the argument does not infer that properties of large institutions apply to all institutions without justification. Therefore, the Answer is B."

If an action taken to secure the survival of a business fails to enhance the welfare of the business's employees, that action cannot be good for the business as a whole. B. Some measures taken by a business to increase productivity fail to be beneficial to the business as a whole. C. Only if the employees of a business are also its owners will the interests of the employees and owners coincide, enabling measures that will be beneficial to the business as a whole. D. There is no business that does not make efforts to increase its productivity. E. Decreasing the number of employees in a business undermines the sense of security of retained employees.",

The phrase 'some measures' directly aligns with the idea that while some efforts may be beneficial, others may not be, which is the crux of the argument. A is incorrect because it is too specific and does not capture the broader conclusion. C is out of scope as it introduces a condition that is not discussed in the passage.

Only some of the minor gases whose presence in the atmosphere allegedly resulted in the phenomenon described by the scientist were produced by industrial pollution. B. Most of the warming occurred before 1940, while most of the buildup of minor gases in the atmosphere occurred after 1940. C.

This is correct because it indicates that most of the warming occurred before the buildup of minor gases, which contradicts the scientist's claim that the warming is primarily due to the buildup of these gases. Option A is incorrect because it does not address the timing of the warming relative to gas buildup. Option C is incorrect because it does not provide a direct contradiction to the argument; it merely states a variation in solar radiation without linking it to temperature increase. Option D is incorrect as it suggests a mechanism that could potentially cool the Earth, but does not directly counter the argument about gas buildup. Option E is incorrect because it supports the argument by stating that gas accumulation has been significant over the last century. Therefore, the Answer is B."

D. Milk that has been heated in a microwave oven does not taste noticeably different from milk that has been briefly heated by exposure to a conventional heat source. E. Heating any liquid by microwave creates small zones within it that are much hotter than the overall temperature that the liquid will ultimately reach.",

This is correct because it suggests that when milk is heated in a microwave, localized hot zones can exceed 50 degrees Celsius, potentially destroying the lysozyme. This weakens the argument by indicating that it is not the microwaves themselves that destroy the enzyme, but rather the heat generated in those localized areas. A is incorrect because it does not address the specific temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. B is irrelevant as it discusses replacing enzymes rather than the cause of their destruction.

This is correct because it addresses a critical assumption that each year's most prevalent strain of influenza is different from the previous year's strain. If the same strain were to be prevalent year after year, there would be no need for high-risk individuals to receive a different vaccine annually. Option A is incorrect because changes in the number of individuals in the high-risk group do not affect the need for different vaccines.

A pound of meat is more nutritious for humans than a pound of grain, but sixteen pounds of grain could feed many more people than could a pound of meat. With grain yields leveling off, large areas of farmland going out of production each year, and the population rapidly expanding, we must accept the fact that consumption of meat will soon be morally unacceptable.",
        "question": "Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the ethicist's argument? A. Even though it has been established that a vegetarian diet can be healthy, many people prefer to eat meat and are willing to pay for it. B. Often, cattle or sheep can be raised to maturity on grass from pastureland that is unsuitable for any other kind of farming. C. If a grain diet is supplemented with protein derived from non-animal sources, it can have nutritional value equivalent to that of a diet containing meat. D. Although prime farmland near metropolitan areas is being lost rapidly to suburban development, we could reverse this trend by choosing to live in areas that are already urban. E. Nutritionists agree that a diet composed solely of grain products is not adequate for human health.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is B. This is correct because it introduces the idea that cattle or sheep can be raised on pastureland unsuitable for grain farming, suggesting that meat production does not necessarily require grain that could otherwise feed humans. This weakens the ethicist's argument that meat consumption will soon be morally unacceptable due to grain scarcity. A is incorrect because it does not address the moral implications of meat consumption. C is incorrect because it suggests that a grain diet can be nutritionally sufficient, which supports the argument against meat consumption. D is incorrect as it provides a hypothetical solution that does not directly address the grain versus meat issue. E is incorrect because it discusses the inadequacy of a grain-only diet, which does not weaken the argument about meat consumption. Therefore, the answer is B."

Of the respondents who had received treatment for longer than 6 months, 10 percent said that treatment made things worse. B. Patients who had received treatment for longer than 6 months were more likely to respond to the survey than were those who had received treatment for a shorter time. C. Patients who feel they are doing well in treatment tend to remain in treatment, while those who are doing poorly tend to quit earlier. D. Patients who were dissatisfied with their treatment were more likely to feel a need to express their feelings about it and thus to return the survey. E. Many psychologists encourage their patients to receive treatment for longer than 6 months.",

This is correct because it suggests that patients who feel they are benefiting from treatment are more likely to continue with it, which could explain the higher percentage of positive responses in the longer treatment group. This indicates that the effectiveness of treatment may not be solely due to its duration but rather the patients' perception of its effectiveness. A is incorrect because knowing that 10 percent felt worse does not directly weaken the argument about the effectiveness of longer treatment. B is incorrect because it does not address the effectiveness of treatment but rather the response rate, which does not impact the conclusion. D is incorrect as it similarly does not differentiate between the groups in terms of treatment effectiveness. E is irrelevant as it does not provide any evidence to weaken the argument."

If the workers do go on strike, it implies that management did not increase wages, and thus the subsidiaries would not need to be sold. Therefore, the assumption that the workers will not go on strike is crucial for the conclusion to hold. A is incorrect because the argument does not depend on Bell suffering losses; B is incorrect because if management refuses to increase wages, it contradicts the conclusion that subsidiaries will be sold; D is incorrect because the authority of the president is irrelevant to the conclusion; E is incorrect because it does not directly impact the conclusion about selling subsidiaries.",

Therefore, for the conclusion that subsidiaries will be sold to be valid, it must be assumed that the workers will not strike. If they do strike, it means wages were not increased, and thus subsidiaries would not need to be sold. Therefore, option C is the correct assumption.",

        "background": "Coherent solutions for the problem of reducing health-care costs cannot be found within the current piecemeal system of paying these costs. The reason is that this system gives health-care providers and insurers every incentive to shift, wherever possible, the costs of treating illness onto each other or any other party, including the patient. That clearly is the lesson of the various reforms of the 1980s: push in on one part of this pliable spending balloon and an equally expensive bulge pops up elsewhere.",
        "question": "The argument provides the most support for which one of the following? A. Under the conditions in which the current system operates, the overall volume of health-care costs could be shrunk, if at all, only by a comprehensive approach. B. Relative to the resources available for health-care funding, the income of the higher-paid health-care professionals is too high. C. Health-care costs are expanding to meet additional funds that have been made available for them. D. Advances in medical technology have raised the expected standards of medical care but have proved expensive. E. Since unfilled hospital beds contribute to overhead charges on each patient's bill, it would be unwise to hold unused hospital capacity in reserve for large-scale emergencies.",
        "answer": "A. This is correct because the passage argues that the current piecemeal approach to health-care costs is ineffective, suggesting that a comprehensive approach is necessary to address the issue. B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss the income of health-care professionals. C is incorrect as it contradicts the passage's implication that costs are not simply expanding due to additional funds. D is incorrect because it does not address the need for a comprehensive approach to cost reduction. E is incorrect as it is out of scope and does not relate to the argument about reducing health-care costs. Therefore, the Answer is A."

Government motor vehicle regulations generally require all cars, whether old or new, to be inspected for emission levels prior to registration. B. Owners of new cars tend to drive their cars more carefully than do owners of old cars. C. The older a car is, the more likely it is to be discarded for scrap rather than repaired when major engine work is needed to keep the car in operation. D. The cars that the National Motor Company built in the 1970s incorporated simplified engine designs that made the engines less complicated than those of earlier models. E. Many of the repairs that were performed on the cars that the National Motor Company built in the 1960s could have been avoided if periodic routine maintenance had been performed.",

A. This is incorrect because it suggests that older cars would have more repairs due to inspections, which does not explain the discrepancy. B. This is incorrect because it does not relate to the repair statistics of the cars in question. D.

        "question": "The argument against the marine biologists' hypothesis is based on which one of the following assumptions?: A. Lobsters not caught in lobster traps have been observed eating one another. B. Two months is the longest known period during which eight or more lobsters have been trapped together. C. It is unusual to find as many as eight lobsters caught together in one single trap. D. Members of other marine species sometimes eat their own kind when no other food sources are available. E. Any food that the eight lobsters in the trap might have obtained was not enough to ward off hunger.",

This is correct because the argument assumes that the lobsters were hungry and that any food they might have obtained was insufficient to satisfy that hunger. If the lobsters were not hungry, the conclusion that they did not eat one another would not be relevant. Therefore, the assumption that the food was not enough to ward off hunger is crucial to the argument. A is incorrect because it discusses lobsters not in traps, which is irrelevant. B is incorrect because the duration of trapping does not affect the argument about hunger. C is irrelevant as it does not impact the argument regarding cannibalism.

Many street crimes, such as drug dealing, are extremely lucrative and those committing them can afford expensive private lawyers. B. Most prosecutors are not competent to handle cases involving highly technical financial evidence and have more success in prosecuting cases of robbery or simple assault. C. The number of criminals convicted of street crimes is far greater than the number of criminals convicted of embezzlement or insider trading. D. The percentage of defendants who actually committed the crimes of which they are accused is no greater for publicly defended than for privately defended defendants. E. Juries, out of sympathy for the victims of crimes, are much more likely to convict defendants accused of violent crimes than they are to convict defendants accused of 'victimless' crimes or crimes against property.",
        "answer": "D. This is correct because it strengthens the argument by suggesting that the actual guilt rate among defendants is similar, which implies that the lower conviction rate for those with private lawyers is due to the effectiveness of those lawyers. A is incorrect because it weakens the argument by suggesting that street criminals could also avoid conviction if they could afford private lawyers. B is incorrect because it provides an alternative explanation for the lower conviction rates, thus weakening the original argument.

In the first 12 months after the change, the rate of highway fatalities dropped 15 percent, the sharpest one-year drop in history. Over the next 10 years, the fatality rate declined by another 25 percent. It follows that the 1974 reduction in the speed limit saved many lives.",
        "question": "Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A. The 1974 fuel shortage cut driving sharply for more than a year. B. There was no decline in the rate of highway fatalities during the twelfth year following the reduction in the speed limit. C. Since 1974 automobile manufacturers have been required by law to install lifesaving equipment, such as seat belts, in all new cars. D. The fatality rate in highway accidents involving motorists driving faster than 55 miles per hour is much higher than in highway accidents that do not involve motorists driving at such speeds. E. Motorists are more likely to avoid accidents by matching their speed to that of the surrounding highway traffic than by driving at faster or slower speeds.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is D. This is correct because it provides a direct link between the reduced speed limit and a lower fatality rate, indicating that lower speeds lead to fewer fatal accidents. A lower speed limit should reduce the rate of highway fatalities, as it suggests that driving at higher speeds increases the risk of fatal injuries in accidents. A is incorrect because it suggests an alternative reason for the drop in fatalities, weakening the argument. B is incorrect as it does not explain the decrease in fatalities during the first eleven years following the speed limit reduction. C weakens the argument by introducing an alternative cause for the decrease in fatalities, attributing it to lifesaving equipment rather than the speed limit. E is incorrect because it implies that matching speeds with surrounding traffic is more important than the speed limit itself, thus weakening the argument that the speed limit directly affects fatality rates.

Cost considerations favor sacrificing consistency over sacrificing flavor. C. It would not be cost effective to develop a new device to maintain the constancy of freezer temperatures. D. Stabilizers function well only at very low freezer temperatures. E. Very low, stable freezer temperatures allow for the best possible consistency and flavor of ice cream.",

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not state that slight deviations in consistency directly impair flavor. Option B is incorrect because the passage suggests that cost considerations favor higher temperatures, which would require stabilizers that adversely affect flavor.

This is correct because it explains that Impanians are only purchasing private insurance when they anticipate needing specific medical procedures not covered by the National Health scheme. This leads to a smaller pool of insured individuals, who are more likely to make claims, thus increasing the overall cost of insurance. A. This is incorrect because if overhead costs decrease, it would not explain the increase in insurance costs. B. This is incorrect because if a large portion of costs are now covered by the National Health scheme, private insurance rates should decrease. C.

This is correct because if one half of last year's top-priority emergencies were gunshot wounds and electrocution cases, then excluding these time-consuming cases from the current year's definition of top-priority emergencies would logically lead to a reduction in the average turnaround time. A is incorrect because the number of heart attacks and strokes declining does not address the impact of excluding gunshot wounds and electrocutions. B is incorrect as it is irrelevant to the argument about ambulance turnaround times. C is incorrect because expert opinions do not strengthen the factual basis of the argument. D is incorrect as the definitions used by other cities do not affect the local context of the mayor's claims. Therefore, the answer is E."

This is correct because the argument suggests that a superior conductor earns the authority to demand more rehearsal time by winning the orchestra's respect for their artistic interpretations. For this to happen, the orchestra must be able to appreciate the conductor's interpretations even before they are fully realized. If they cannot appreciate the interpretation beforehand, they would not respect the conductor's authority to insist on more practice. A is incorrect because the argument does not discuss different interpretations for each orchestra. B is incorrect as the argument does not mention the conductor's satisfaction with performances. C is irrelevant because the argument does not hinge on the orchestra's readiness to work more, but rather on their respect for the conductor's interpretations.

        "question": "Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the argument depends? A. Training programs can eliminate pilot errors. B. Commercial pilots routinely undergo additional training throughout their careers. C. The number of airline crashes will decrease if pilot training programs focus on increasing actual flying time. D. Lack of actual flying time is an important contributor to pilot error in commercial plane crashes. E. Communication skills are not important to pilot training programs.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is D. Lack of actual flying time is an important contributor to pilot error in commercial plane crashes. This is correct because the argument hinges on the idea that without sufficient flying time, pilot errors will not be adequately addressed by the current training programs. If lack of flying time is not a significant contributor, then the conclusion that airlines should rethink their training approach would not hold. Option A is incorrect because the argument does not claim that training programs can completely eliminate pilot errors, only that they need to be improved. Option B is irrelevant as it does not impact the argument's conclusion. Option C is misleading because it implies a direct cause-effect relationship that is not established in the argument; the argument suggests that increasing flying time is necessary but does not guarantee a decrease in crashes. Option E is incorrect as it dismisses the importance of communication skills, which are acknowledged in the argument but deemed insufficient without actual flying time."

The large amount of genetic material that people share with all other people and with other animals is not included in the DNA fingerprinting procedure. B. There is generally accepted theoretical basis for interpreting the patterns produced by the procedure. C. In the whole population there are various different subgroups, within each of which certain sets of genetic characteristics are shared. D. The skill required of laboratory technicians performing the DNA fingerprinting procedure is not extraordinary. E. In the investigation of certain genetic diseases, the techniques used in DNA fingerprinting have traced the transmission of the diseases among the living members of very large families.",

This is correct because it suggests that certain subgroups share genetic characteristics, which undermines the assumption of independence between characteristics in DNA patterns. A match could occur more frequently than expected if individuals within subgroups share similar genetic traits. A is incorrect because it states that shared genetic material is not included in the procedure, which does not affect the independence assumption. B is irrelevant as it discusses theoretical interpretation rather than the odds of a match. D is out of scope as it addresses technician skill, not the independence of genetic characteristics.

In the United States a significant proportion of the commercial honey supply comes from hobby beekeepers, many of whom are likely to abandon beekeeping with the influx of Africanized bees. E. The area of Brazil where the comparative study was done is far better suited to the foraging habits of the Africanized honeybees than are most areas of the United States.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because the statement about ornamental trees does not directly relate to honey production and does not weaken the argument regarding the potential decline of honey production in the United States. A weakens the argument by suggesting that the Brazilian bees may not be comparable to U.S. bees. B weakens the argument by indicating that Africanized bees may complicate production. D weakens the argument by highlighting the potential loss of hobby beekeepers, which would reduce honey production. E weakens the argument by suggesting that conditions in Brazil may not be replicable in the U.S., thus affecting honey production."

As a result of astonishing recent technological advances, the cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic power plants, allowing for both construction and operating costs, is one-tenth of what it was 20 years ago, whereas the corresponding cost for traditional plants, which burn fossil fuels, has increased. Thus, photovoltaic power plants offer a less expensive approach to meeting demand for electricity than do traditional power plants.",

The cost of producing electric power at traditional plants has increased over the past 20 years. B. Twenty years ago, traditional power plants were producing 10 times more electric power than were photovoltaic plants. C. None of the recent technological advances in producing electric power at photovoltaic plants can be applied to producing power at traditional plants. D. Twenty years ago, the cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic plants was less than 20 times the cost of producing power at traditional plants. E. The cost of producing electric power at photovoltaic plants is expected to decrease further, while the cost of producing power at traditional plants is not expected to decrease.",

This is correct because it provides the necessary information about the historical cost relationship between photovoltaic and traditional power plants, which is essential to support the conclusion that photovoltaic plants are currently less expensive. A is incorrect because it only addresses the cost of traditional plants without comparing it to photovoltaic plants. B is incorrect because it discusses the amount of electricity produced rather than costs. C is incorrect as it does not provide relevant information about the cost comparison.

A. Are owners who are cautious enough to join the program taking other special measures to protect their cars against theft? B. In how many neighborhoods is the police program operating? C. Are cars in neighborhoods that are actively participating in the program sometimes stolen during daylight hours? D. Will owners who have placed decals on their cars' windows but who find it necessary to drive between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M. be harassed by police? E. Are the neighborhoods in which the program has been put into effect a representative cross section of neighborhoods with respect to the types of automobiles owned by residents?",
        "answer": "A. This is correct because if owners are taking other measures to protect their cars, it could indicate that the reduction in theft is not solely due to the program. If they are not taking other measures, it suggests that the program is effective in reducing theft. B. This is incorrect because the number of neighborhoods does not directly evaluate the program's effectiveness. C. This is incorrect because the question of daylight theft does not directly relate to the program's effectiveness during the specified hours. D. This is incorrect as harassment by police does not evaluate the program's success. E.

This is correct because the argument concludes that Western diets better protect against cerebral hemorrhage, which implies that they must result in higher blood cholesterol levels compared to non-Western diets. This connection is necessary to support the conclusion drawn from the premises. A is incorrect because it makes a broad assumption about the overall healthiness of diets without addressing cholesterol levels. C is incorrect because it does not connect diets to cholesterol levels, and it only discusses the effects of high cholesterol without addressing the argument's focus.

Computers are as good as teachers at drilling students on facts and rules. B. The job of a teacher is to make students understand the general concepts underlying specific facts and rules. C. It is possible to program computers so that they can teach the understanding of general concepts that underlie specific facts and rules. D.

Therefore, if leachate does not escape, it implies that the capacity has not been exceeded. Option A is incorrect because predicting the volume does not necessarily solve the disposal problem. Option B is incorrect as it misinterprets the condition; leachate escapes only if the capacity is exceeded, not merely because water permeates. Option C is incorrect because the passage states that not all plants are incapable, implying some can handle leachate. Option D is incorrect because it assumes leachate is sent to plants that cannot handle it, which is not supported by the passage. Therefore, the answer is E."

Smaller spaceships require less fuel than larger spaceships. C. Information learned during the trip to Phobos can be used during a subsequent trip to Mars. D. The shortest distance between Phobos and Mars is less than half the shortest distance between Earth and Mars. E. Lift-off for the return trip from Phobos requires much less fuel than that from Mars because of Phobos weaker gravitational pull.",

This is correct because it explains that the fuel consumption during lift-off from Phobos is less than that from Mars due to Phobos' weaker gravitational pull, thereby supporting the argument that the fuel requirement for the Phobos expedition is less than for Mars. A. This is incorrect because it discusses equipment requirements rather than fuel requirements. B. This is incorrect because it relates fuel requirement to the size of the spaceship, which is not specified for either expedition. C.

Before he could telegraph to freeze the project, the whole cantilever arm broke off and plunged, along with seven dozen workers, into the St. Lawrence River. It was the worst bridge construction disaster in history. As a direct result of the inquiry that followed, the engineering 'rules of thumb' by which thousands of bridges had been built went down with the Quebec Bridge. Twentieth-century bridge engineers would thereafter depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis.",
        "question": "Which one of the following statements can be properly inferred from the passage? A. Bridges built before about 1907 were built without thorough mathematical analysis and, therefore, were unsafe for the public to use. B. Cooper's absence from the Quebec Bridge construction site resulted in the breaking off of the cantilever. C. Nineteenth-century bridge engineers relied on their rules of thumb because analytical methods were inadequate to solve their design problems. D. Only a more rigorous application of mathematical analysis to the design of the Quebec Bridge could have prevented its collapse. E. Prior to 1907 the mathematical analysis incorporated in engineering rules of thumb was insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction.",
        "answer": "E. This is correct because the passage indicates that the engineering rules of thumb used before 1907 were insufficient, as evidenced by the collapse of the Quebec Bridge. The inquiry that followed the disaster led to the abandonment of these rules, suggesting they were inadequate for ensuring safety. A is incorrect because it makes an extreme claim about all bridges built before 1907 being unsafe, which is not supported by the passage. B is incorrect as the passage does not establish a causal link between Cooper's absence and the collapse. C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information on why engineers relied on rules of thumb. D is incorrect because the passage does not state that a more rigorous application of mathematical analysis was the only way to prevent the collapse; other solutions may have existed.

Dr. Tyson claims they are clearly early hominid footprints since they show human characteristics: a squarish heel and a big toe immediately adjacent to the next toe. However, since the footprints indicate that if hominids made those prints they would have had to walk in an unexpected cross-stepping manner, by placing the left foot to the right of the right foot. Dr. Rees rejects Dr. Tyson's conclusion.",
        "question": "Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines Dr. Tyson's conclusion? A. The foot prints showing human characteristics were clearly those of at least two distinct individuals. B. Certain species of bears had feet very like human feet, except that the outside toe on each foot was the biggest toe and the innermost toe was the smallest toe. C. Footprints shaped like a human's that do not show a cross-stepping pattern exist at site M, which is a mile away from site G, and the two sets of footprints are contemporaneous. D. When the moist volcanic ash became sealed under additional layers of ash before hardening, some details of some of the footprints were erased. E. Most of the other footprints at site G were of animals with hooves.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is B. This is correct because if certain species of bears have feet very similar to human feet, but with the toe order reversed, it suggests that the footprints could belong to bears rather than early hominids. This undermines Dr. Tyson's conclusion that the footprints are from early hominids. A is incorrect because it suggests multiple individuals, which could still support the idea of early hominids. C is incorrect because it provides evidence of human-like footprints without the cross-stepping pattern, which could support Dr. Tyson's argument. D does not affect the argument significantly as both paleontologists are using the same set of prints. E is irrelevant to the specific argument about the nature of the footprints in question. Therefore, the answer is B."

        "question": "Therefore, if such direct transmission occurs, the disease cannot be eradicated by __________. Which one of the following best completes the argument? A. removing from the herd and destroying any diseased animal as soon as it shows the typical symptoms of advanced BSE B. developing a drug that kills the agent that cause BSE, and then treating with that drug all cattle that might have the disease C. destroying all cattle in areas where BSE occurs and raising cattle only in areas to which BSE is known not to have spread D. developing a vaccine that confers lifelong immunity against BSE and giving it to all cattle, destroying in due course all those animals for which the vaccine protection came too late E. developing a diagnostic test that does identify any infected animal and destroying all animals found to be infected",
        "answer": "The correct answer is A. This is correct because removing diseased animals only after they show symptoms does not prevent the spread of the disease, as it is unknown whether the disease can be transmitted at earlier stages of infection. Therefore, by the time symptoms appear, the disease may have already spread to other animals. B is incorrect because if a drug that kills the BSE agent is developed, it could potentially eradicate the disease. C is incorrect because destroying all cattle in affected areas would eliminate the disease from that area. D is incorrect because a vaccine could prevent the disease from spreading if administered to all cattle. E is incorrect because developing a diagnostic test would allow for the identification and destruction of infected animals before they can spread the disease. Therefore, the answer is A."

Aluminum is the cause of the disorder rather than merely an effect of it. C. Introducing the compound into the brain tissue has no side effects. D. The amount of the compound needed to neutralize the aluminum in an animal's brain tissue varies depending upon the species. E. Aluminum is never present in normal brain tissue.",

If aluminum were merely an effect of the disorder, then treating with the silicon-based compound would not address the underlying issue. A is incorrect because the variability of aluminum levels does not affect the argument's conclusion. C is incorrect because side effects of the compound do not impact the assumption about the cause of the disorder. D is incorrect as the amount of compound needed does not relate to the assumption about aluminum's role.

This skeleton had a partial pelvis.",
        "question": "If the statements above are true, which one of the following, if also true, would most strongly support the conclusion that the fragile hind limbs are remnants of limbs that land-dwelling whales once had? A. Whale bones older than the fossilized hind limbs confirm that ancient whales had full pelvises. B. No skeletons of ancient whales with intact hind limbs capable of supporting the mammals' weight have ever been found. C. Scientists are uncertain whether the apparently non-functioning limbs of other early mammals derived from once-functioning limbs of their ancestors. D.

The huge dust cloud described in the passage would have blocked the transmission of sunlight and lowered the earth's temperature. B. A layer of sedimentary rock takes millions of years to harden. C. Layers of sedimentary rock are used to determine the dates of prehistoric events whether or not they contain iridium. D. Sixty million years ago there was a surge in volcanic activity in which the matter spewed from the volcanoes formed huge iridium-rich dust clouds. E. The iridium deposit occurred at about the same time that many animal species became extinct and some scientists have theorized that mass dinosaur extinctions were caused by a meteorite collision.",

Whenever one incumbent is responsible for one major political scandal and another incumbent is responsible for another, the consequences for the two incumbents should be the same. B. When a major political scandal is blamed on incumbents from all parties, that judgment is more accurate than any judgment that incumbents from only one party are to blame. C. Incumbents who are rightly blamed for a major political scandal should not seek reelection, but if they do, they should not be returned to office. D. Major political scandals can practically always be blamed on incumbents, but whether those incumbents should be voted out of office depends on who their challengers are. E. When major political scandals are less the responsibility of individual incumbents than of the parties to which they belong, whatever party was responsible must be penalized when possible.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is E. This is correct because it explains that when a scandal is attributed to a party rather than individual incumbents, voters will penalize the party by voting out its incumbents. In scenario 1, where all parties are blamed, voters have no specific party to penalize, so they tend to stick with incumbents. In scenario 2, when one party is blamed, voters can easily choose to vote out the incumbents of that party. A is incorrect because it discusses individual incumbents rather than the party dynamics.

In the long run, the advantages of advanced medical technology are likely to be outweighed by the disadvantages. C. The total amount spent on cataract surgery has increased because the increased number of people electing to have the surgery more than offsets the decrease in cost per operation. D. Huge increases in the nation's health care costs are due primarily to increased demand for surgery for older people. E. Ten years ago, cataract surgery was affordable for more people than it was last year.",

The total amount spent on cataract surgery has increased because the increased number of people electing to have the surgery more than offsets the decrease in cost per operation. This is correct because the passage indicates that while the cost per operation has decreased due to advancements in technology, the total expenditure has increased due to a significant rise in the number of surgeries performed. A is incorrect because it does not provide a clear inference about success rates. B is irrelevant as it discusses advantages and disadvantages not mentioned in the passage. D is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the cause of increased health care costs to only older people, which is not supported by the text.

The other options suggest reasons related to population dynamics or health insurance coverage that could explain the increase in surgeries, thereby challenging the assertion that technological advancements are the primary reason for the increase. A is incorrect because an increase in population could lead to more surgeries. B is incorrect because a higher chance of developing cataracts would lead to more surgeries.

Tenants prefer low-quality accommodations with rent control to high-quality accommodations without it. B. Rent control makes it very difficult for landlords to achieve reasonable returns on any investments in maintenance or in new construction. C. Rent control is a common practice even though it does nothing to alleviate shortages in rental housing. D. Rent control is generally introduced for political reasons and it takes political action to have it lifted again. E. Tenants prefer rent control to the alternative of receiving direct government subsidies toward rents they cannot afford.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is B. This is correct because rent control limits the potential income landlords can earn from their properties, making it challenging for them to justify investments in maintenance or new construction. This leads to a reluctance to maintain existing properties and to build new ones. A is incorrect because tenants' preferences for low-quality accommodations do not directly impact landlords' willingness to maintain quality. C is incorrect as it does not address the landlords' reluctance. D is also incorrect because the political reasons for rent control do not explain landlords' reluctance. E is incorrect as it does not impact landlords' decisions regarding property maintenance or construction. Therefore the Answer is B."

(B) When an animal is in danger of dying, there is an obligation to help save its life, if doing so would not interfere with the health or well-being of other animals or people. (C) The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation. (D) Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed. (E) Species that are found in only one circumscribed geographical region ought to be given more care and attention than are other species because they are more vulnerable to extinction.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because the naturalists' argument hinges on the distinction between local and global extinction. Initially, the South Island tuatara were not considered a priority for protection because they were thought to be the same as the North Island tuatara. However, once it was established that they are a distinct species, the potential for global extinction became apparent, thus creating an obligation to act. A. This is incorrect because the argument does not focus on maximizing the number of living things, but rather on the specific obligation to protect a unique species. B. This is incorrect because it addresses individual animals rather than the species as a whole. D.

The view that there was trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages can only be disproved by showing that no references to this trade exist in surviving records. E. There is no more evidence that trade between Europe and East Asia existed in the early Middle Ages than there is that the Yeti exists.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because it directly addresses the argument's main point that the absence of evidence does not prove non-existence. The analogy with the Yeti illustrates that just because there are no sightings does not mean the Yeti does not exist. Similarly, the lack of written records does not prove that trade did not occur. A is incorrect because it suggests that evidence is not scientifically confirmed, which is not the main point. B is incorrect as it introduces the need for both Asian and European evidence, which is outside the scope of the argument. D is incorrect because it implies that the existence of trade can only be disproven with specific evidence, which contradicts the argument's assertion. E is incorrect as it makes a comparison that is not relevant to the argument's focus on absence of evidence.",
        "explanation": "The argument emphasizes that the absence of evidence (whether for the Yeti or for trade between Europe and East Asia) does not equate to proof of non-existence. Option C encapsulates this idea perfectly, stating that one cannot conclude that trade did not exist simply because there is no evidence of it. Option A incorrectly implies that the evidence for trade is similar to that for the Yeti, which is not the crux of the argument. Option B introduces unnecessary conditions for proving trade existed, which is not relevant to the argument's point. Option D suggests that the argument can only be disproven with specific evidence, which contradicts the main assertion. Lastly, option E fails to maintain the focus on the absence of evidence and instead draws a misleading comparison."

        "question": "Which one of the following considerations, if true, best counters the argument? A. Most of the evidence for the existence of trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages is archaeological and therefore does not rely on written records. B. Although written records of trade in East Asia in the early Middle Ages survived, there are almost no Europe documents from that period that mention trade at all. C. Any trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages would necessarily have been of very low volume and would have involved high-priced items, such as precious metals and silk. D. There have been no confirmed sightings of the Yeti, but there is indirect evidence, such as footprints, which if it is accepted as authentic would establish the Yeti's existence. E. There are surviving European and East Asian written records from the early Middle Ages that do not mention trade between the two regions but would have been very likely to do so if this trade had existed.",
        "answer": "E. This is correct because it highlights a significant flaw in the analogy presented in the argument. It states that there are surviving records that would have likely mentioned trade if it existed, and their absence serves as strong evidence against the existence of such trade. A, B, C, and D do not effectively counter the argument. A shifts focus to archaeological evidence, which does not address the lack of written records. B notes a lack of European documents but does not counter the argument's logic. C discusses the nature of trade but does not address the argument's core. D introduces indirect evidence for the Yeti but does not counter the analogy effectively. Therefore, the answer is E."

        "question": "Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?: A. Any current attempts by agricultural researchers to develop higher-yielding potato strains are futile. B. Strains of potatoes most commonly grown in Rosinia could not have produced the yields last year that they once did. C. Agricultural researchers often find concrete solutions to practical problems when investigating seemingly unrelated questions. D. Wide fluctuations in the size of the potato crop over a twenty-year period are not unusual. E. Agricultural research in Rosinia is funded by government grants.",

That a given social policy has traditionally been in force justifies maintaining that policy only if doing so does not conflict with more pressing social needs. B. Appeals to its own traditions cannot excuse a country from the obligation to bring its practices in line with the legitimate expectations of the rest of the world. C. Because appeals to tradition often serve to mask the real interests at issue, such appeals should be disregarded. D. Traditional principles should be discarded when they no longer serve the needs of the economy. E. The actual tradition embodied in a given practice can be accurately identified only by reference to the reasons that originally prompted that practice.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is E. This is correct because the argument emphasizes that the tradition of a three-month summer vacation was based on the economic need for child labor during harvest time. Therefore, understanding the original reasons behind a tradition is crucial for evaluating its relevance today. A is incorrect because it does not address the need to evaluate the reasons behind the tradition. B is incorrect as it shifts focus to international expectations rather than the economic rationale.

No likely mechanism of contamination involving percolating groundwater would have affected the deeper samples from the site without affecting the uppermost sample. B. Not every application of the carbon-dating procedure has led to results that have been generally acceptable to scientists. C. There is no evidence that people were using coal for fuel at any time when the deepest layer might have been laid down. D. No sample in the series, when retested by the carbon-dating procedure, was assigned an earlier date than that assigned to a sample from a layer above it. E. No North American site besides the one in Pennsylvania has ever yielded a sample to which the carbon-dating procedure assigned a date that was comparably ancient.",

This is correct because it directly addresses the skeptics' suggestion of contamination by indicating that if percolating groundwater had contaminated the deeper samples, it would have also affected the uppermost sample, which is dated to the present day. Therefore, the mechanism of contamination proposed by the skeptics is unlikely. B is incorrect because it does not address the specific contamination claim.

The possibility is left open that the statistics for manufacturers' share of revenues come from a different source than the other statistics. B. No matter what changes the automobile industry's overall revenues undergo, the total of all shares of these revenues must be 100 percent. C.

Revenues are an important factor but are not the only factor in determining profits.",

This is correct because it highlights the logical flaw in the argument: the percentage shares of revenue do not provide information about the total revenue of the automobile industry. Regardless of how the shares are distributed, they will always sum to 100%, which means we cannot determine if the overall revenues have increased or decreased based solely on these percentages. A is incorrect because the source of the statistics does not affect their validity in this context. C is incorrect because the lack of explanation for the changes in revenue shares does not invalidate the argument.

There must be a reason the normally latent virus could prevail so suddenly: clearly the severe pollution of the North Sea waters must have weakened the immune system of the seals so that they could no longer withstand the virus.",
        "question": "The argument concerning the immune system of the seals presupposes which one of the following?: A. There has been a gradual decline in the seal population of the North Sea during the past two centuries. B. No further sources of pollution have been added since May 1988 to the already existing sources of pollution in the North Sea. C. There was no sudden mutation in the distemper virus which would have allowed the virus successfully to attack healthy North Sea seals by May 1988. D. Pollution in the North Sea is no greater than pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of North America, or in the Sea of Japan. E. Some species that provide food for the seals have nearly become extinct as a result of the pollution.",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because the argument assumes that the only reason for the seals' increased susceptibility to the virus is the pollution weakening their immune systems. If there was a sudden mutation in the virus, it could explain the deaths without needing to rely on the pollution factor. A. This is incorrect because it does not directly relate to the argument about the immune system's weakening. B. This is incorrect because adding more pollution would actually strengthen the argument that pollution is the cause. C. This is correct as explained. D. This is incorrect because it does not affect the argument regarding the seals' immune system. E. This is incorrect because while it suggests a potential cause for malnourishment, it does not address the presupposition about the immune system's weakening. Therefore the Answer is C."

Mule deer have enzyme-rich saliva and specialized digestive organs that enable the deer to digest tough plants inedible to other deer species. B. Mule deer herds that inhabit cleared forests tend to have more female with young offspring and fewer adult males than do other mule deer populations. C. Mule deer populations are spread throughout western North America and inhabit hot, sunny climates as well as cool, wet climates. D.

High-temperature incineration minimizes the overall risk to the human population of the country from the wastes being disposed of, but it concentrates the remaining risk in a small number of incineration sites. B. High-temperature incineration is more expensive than any of the available alternatives would be and the higher costs would be recovered through higher product prices. C.

Critics have charged that the proposal poses health risks to people who might eat the meat of treated deer and thereby ingest unsafe quantities of the hormone. The biologist has responded to these critics by pointing out that humans can ingest up to 10 milligrams of the hormone a day without any adverse effects, and since no one would eat even one entire deer a day, the treatment would be safe.",
        "question": "The biologist's response to critics of the proposal is based on which one of the following assumptions? (A) People would be notified of the time when deer in their area were to be treated with the hormone. (B) The hormone that would be injected into the deer is chemically similar to hormones used in human contraceptives. (C) Hunting season for deer could be scheduled so that it would not coincide with breeding season. (D) The hormone in question does not occur naturally in the female deer that would be injected. (E) Most people do not consider deer meat to be part of their daily diet and eat it only on rare occasions.",
        "answer": "D. This is correct because the biologist's argument hinges on the assumption that the only source of the hormone in the deer meat is from the injection. If female deer already contain some amount of the hormone naturally, then the total amount consumed by humans could exceed the safe limit of 10 milligrams per day. Therefore, if the hormone occurs naturally in the deer, the treatment could pose health risks. A is incorrect because the notification of treatment does not affect the safety of the hormone. B is incorrect because the similarity to human contraceptives is irrelevant to the safety of the hormone in deer. C is incorrect as scheduling hunting season does not relate to the hormone's safety.

        "question": "For the claim that the concern expressed by the so-called environmentalists is not their real concern to be properly drawn on the basis of the evidence cited, which one of the following must be assumed? A. Not every development proposal opposed in recent years by these so-called environmentalists was opposed because they believed it to pose a threat to the environment. B. People whose real agenda is to block development wherever it is proposed always try to disguise their true motives. C. Anyone who opposes unrestricted development is an opponent of progress. D.

This is correct because the argument hinges on the idea that the environmentalists' consistent opposition to development projects suggests their true motives are not environmental. If it is assumed that not every proposal was opposed for environmental reasons, it supports the conclusion that their concern for bird-migration patterns may not be genuine. B is incorrect because it makes a broad assumption about all development opponents, which is not necessary for the argument.

If we assume that not every development proposal they opposed was due to genuine environmental concerns, it strengthens the argument that their current opposition to the Golden Lake Development is similarly motivated by something other than concern for bird-migration patterns. B is incorrect because it implies a universal behavior of development opponents that is not necessary to validate the author's argument.

The cost of collecting, sorting, and recycling discarded plastics is currently higher than the cost of manufacturing new plastics from virgin materials. B. Many consumers are unaware of the codes that are stamped on the plastic containers. C. A plastic container almost always has a higher code number after it is recycled than it had before recycling because the recycling process causes a degradation of the quality of the plastic. D.

Communities that collect all discarded plastic containers for potential recycling later dump in landfills plastics with higher-numbered codes only when it is clear that no recycler will take them.",
        "answer": "The correct answer is C. This is correct because it indicates that when low-numbered plastics are recycled, they often result in higher-numbered plastics, which are less likely to be recycled in the future. Therefore, if consumers refuse to buy high-numbered products, there will be less demand for recycled materials, potentially leading to an increase in unrecycled waste. A is incorrect because the cost of recycling does not directly impact the conclusion about consumer purchasing behavior. B is incorrect because consumer awareness does not affect the structural argument about recycling. D is incorrect because the cost of products does not influence the argument's conclusion about reducing unrecycled waste. E is incorrect as it does not undermine the conclusion regarding consumer purchasing behavior and its impact on recycling.",
        "explanation": "Option C undermines the conclusion by suggesting that if consumers stop buying high-numbered plastics, there will be less incentive to recycle low-numbered plastics, as they will eventually degrade into higher-numbered plastics that are not recycled. This creates a cycle where the refusal to buy high-numbered plastics could lead to an increase in unrecycled waste over time. In contrast, option A discusses the cost of recycling, which is irrelevant to the conclusion about consumer behavior. Option B addresses consumer awareness, which does not affect the argument's logic. Option D focuses on pricing, which is not a factor in the conclusion about waste reduction.

This is correct because it explains that while the ozone layer thinned in the upper atmosphere, ozone pollution increased in the lower atmosphere, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the overall effect would be a decrease in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface. A is incorrect because it introduces an irrelevant fact about skin cancer incidence that does not reconcile the discrepancy.

Most inventions by university faculty members would be profitable if patented. C. Publication of reports on research is the only practical way to disseminate information concerning new discoveries. D. Universities that have a motive to suppress information concerning discoveries by their faculty members will occasionally act on that motive. E. If the inventions of a university faculty member are not patented by that university, then they will be patented by the faculty member instead.",

For the argument to hold, it must be assumed that universities will occasionally act on this motive. If they never act on this motive, then the conclusion that suppressing information is incompatible with their obligation to promote the free flow of ideas would not follow. A is incorrect because the argument does not claim that universities are the only institutions with such an obligation. B is incorrect because the argument does not require that most inventions be profitable; it only states that there are potentially valuable discoveries.

        "answer": "D. This is correct because the conclusion drawn by the replication scientists relies on the assumption that their own experiments were less likely to have measurement errors compared to the original experiments. If both sets of experiments were equally likely to have errors, the conclusion about the original results being faulty would not hold. A is incorrect because the detail of the original experiments does not directly relate to the conclusion about measurement errors. B is incorrect as the controversy does not necessarily imply error in the original results.

This is correct because the author argues that educational television is a contradiction because it does not resemble the classroom environment, implying that only experiences similar to those in school can be educational. Option A is incorrect because it does not directly relate to the author's argument about educational television. Option C is incorrect because it weakens the author's argument by suggesting that television can reinforce school values. Option D is incorrect as it is out of scope; the argument does not concern the quality of television programs.

This is correct because it explains that individuals who switch to low-yield cigarettes may smoke more to compensate for the lower nicotine levels, which could maintain or even increase their risk of heart disease. A is incorrect because it does not address the health implications of smoking low-yield cigarettes. B is incorrect as it discusses secondhand smoke, which is not relevant to the discrepancy in heart attack incidence. C is incorrect because it downplays the role of nicotine without addressing the overall smoking behavior.

        "background": "The Gulches is an area of volcanic rock that is gashed by many channels that lead downhill from the site of a prehistoric glacier to a river. The channels clearly were cut by running water. It was once accepted as fact that the cutting occurred gradually, as the glacier melted. But one geologist theorized that the channels were cut in a short time by an enormous flood. The channels do show physical evidence of having been formed quickly, but the flood theory was originally rejected because scientists knew of no natural process that could melt so much ice so quickly. Paradoxically, today the scientific community accepts the flood theory even though scientists still do not know of a process that can melt so much ice so quickly.",
        "question": "Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the passage? A. Rippies, which indicate that the channels were cut by water, have been discovered in the floors of the channels. B. The Guiches is known to be similar in certain respects to many other volcanic rock formations. C. More than one glacier was present in the area during prehistoric times. D. Volcanic rock is more easily cut by water than are other forms of rock. E. Scientists now believe that the prehistoric glacier dammed a source of water, created a huge lake in the process, and then retreated.",
        "answer": "E. This is correct because it provides an alternative explanation for how a flood could have occurred, even if the scientists still do not know how the ice melted so quickly. The idea that a glacier could have dammed water and created a lake suggests a mechanism for a sudden flood, which supports the flood theory. A is incorrect because it does not clarify whether the channels were cut by slow-moving water or floods. B is irrelevant as it does not connect to the flood theory. C is also irrelevant since the number of glaciers does not explain the acceptance of the flood theory. D does not resolve the paradox as it does not address the melting of ice."

        "background": "Advertisement: Attention pond owners! Ninety-eight percent of mosquito larvae in a pond die within minutes after the pond has been treated with BTI. Yet BTI is not toxic to fish, birds, animals, plants, or beneficial insects. So by using BTI regularly to destroy their larvae, you can greatly reduce populations of pesky mosquitoes that hatch in your pond, and you can do so without diminishing the populations of fish, frogs, or beneficial insects in and around the pond.",
        "question": "Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A. The most effective way to control the numbers of mosquitoes in a given area is to destroy the mosquito larvae in that area. B. Populations of mosquitoes are not dependent on a single body of water within an area as a place for their larvae to hatch and develop. C. There are no insect pests besides mosquitoes that pond owners might want to eliminate from in and around their pond. D. The effectiveness of BTI in destroying mosquito larvae in a pond does not require the pond owner's strict adherence to specific application procedures. E. The fish, frogs, and beneficial insects in and around a pond-owner's pond do not depend on mosquito larvae as an important source of food.",
        "answer": "E. This is correct because the argument concludes that using BTI will not harm other species in the pond while effectively reducing mosquito populations. If fish, frogs, and beneficial insects depend on mosquito larvae for food, then destroying the larvae would negatively impact these species, contradicting the argument's conclusion. A is incorrect because it discusses the effectiveness of controlling mosquitoes but does not address the impact on other species. B is incorrect as it does not relate to the argument's conclusion about the effects of BTI on other species. C is irrelevant to the argument's focus on mosquito larvae and their impact on other species. D is also incorrect because the argument does not hinge on the application procedures of BTI but rather on the ecological impact of using it."

        "background": "Throughout European history famines have generally been followed by periods of rising wages, because when a labor force is diminished, workers are more valuable in accordance with the law of supply and demand. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s is an exception; it resulted in the death or emigration of half of Ireland's population, but there was no significant rise in the average wages in Ireland in the following decade.",
        "question": "Which one of the following, if true, would LEAST contribute to an explanation of the exception to the generalization? A. Improved medical care reduced the mortality rate among able-bodied adults in the decade following the famine to below prefamine levels. B. Eviction policies of the landowners in Ireland were designed to force emigration of the elderly and infirm, who could not work, and to retain a high percentage of able-bodied workers. C. Advances in technology increased the efficiency of industry and agriculture, and so allowed maintenance of economic output with less demand for labor. D. The birth rate increased during the decade following the famine, and this compensated for much of the loss of population that was due to the famine. E. England, which had political control of Ireland, legislated artificially low wages to provide English-owned industry and agriculture in Ireland with cheap labor.",
        "answer": "D. This is correct because an increase in the birth rate does not directly contribute to the labor supply of able-bodied workers in the short term, as infants cannot work. Therefore, while the population may have increased, the number of available workers did not, which does not explain the lack of wage increase. A, B, C, and E all provide explanations for why wages did not rise despite a reduced labor force. A suggests that the labor supply remained stable due to improved health, B indicates that eviction policies preserved the able-bodied workforce, C states that technological advances reduced the need for labor, and E points to legislative actions that kept wages low."

If in such a circumstance the value of a particular investment declines by more than that percentage, it must be true that _________",
        "question": "Which one of the following logically completes the argument? A) the rate of inflation has risen B) the investment in question is becoming less profitable C) the investment in question is less profitable than the most profitable investment available D) the rate of return on the most profitable investment available has declined E) there has been a change in which particular investment happens to be the most profitable available",
        "answer": "C. This is correct because if the value of a particular investment declines by more than the minimum percentage (the difference between inflation and the most profitable investment's return), it indicates that this investment is less profitable than the most profitable investment available. A is incorrect because the rate of inflation being higher is already established in the background. B is vague and does not provide a definitive comparison. D is also incorrect as it does not logically follow from the premise. E is out of scope since it introduces an external factor not mentioned in the argument."
