Copying in examination in fact almost as commonplace as the acts of driving without a valid driving license or traveling without a valid ticket.\n\nConclusion: The act of copying in examination is in fact almost as mundane as the acts of driving without a valid driving license or traveling without a valid ticket.\n\nPredict a Weakener\n\nWe need to weaken the conclusion that the act of copying in examination is almost as ordinary as the acts of driving without a valid driving license or traveling without a valid ticket.\n\nWe must cast a doubt over the comparison between the act of copying in examination and the acts of driving without a valid driving license and traveling without a valid ticket. The weakener of the argument would be something that shows Copying in Examinations to be extraordinary (in some respect) as compared to the other two acts.\n\nThough all the three acts mentioned attract punishments, do the quantum or the degree of punishments differ? Certainly, they do! The punishments for driving without a valid driving license and traveling without a valid ticket are usually monetary; however, those for copying in examination could be: disgrace, discredit for the test, reexamination, repetition of the course, debarring from the course, and in the extreme case, criminal prosecution. These are certainly severer than the monitory punishments. And this makes the act of copying in examination incomparable to that of driving without a valid driving license and traveling without a valid ticket.\n\nPredictive Weakener: The consequences for the act of copying in examination are severer than those for driving without a valid driving license and traveling without a valid ticket.\n\nAnswer choices explanation:\n\nA. This is incorrect. The statement does not talk about the act of copying in examination. It tries to make a relationship between the other two acts, which are not the focus of the conclusion.\nB. This is correct. This matches our predictive weakener.\nC. This is incorrect. The premise mentions that the number of students caught each year for the three acts of wrongdoings is similar. This option states that there are fewer students who are inclined to try driving without a valid driving license and traveling without a valid ticket than are inclined to try copying in examination. So, we can infer that there is a relatively greater number of students who copy in examinations. Thus, this option rather bolsters the claim that the act of copying in examination is in fact almost as mundane as (or, in fact, more mundane than) the acts of driving without a valid driving license or traveling without a valid ticket. It is rather a strengthener.\nD. This is incorrect. This is not a weakener. It is a generic statement and lacks reasoning to weaken the argument.\nE. This is incorrect. From the premise, we know that the number of students caught copying in examination is similar to the number driving without a valid driving license or traveling without a valid ticket. However, the probability of getting caught for each of these three wrongdoings may be different. For example, copying in examinations may be more strictly checked than traveling without a valid ticket. Therefore, the prevalence of the three wrongdoings may be different. This option does not give us any information to mark out copying in examinations as in any way extraordinary or distinct from the other two wrongdoings."

Kim, on the other hand, maintains that “Saving lives is what counts most of all.” Since pure research saves lives through medical applications, Kim disagrees with Laird about whether pure research has its most valuable achievements in medical applications. The correct response, therefore, is (D).\n\nResponse (A) is incorrect since we can determine, based on their statements, that Laird and Kim agree that pure research “derives its significance in part from its providing new technologies.” Laird explicitly cites the value of pure research with respect to providing new technologies. Kim indicates agreement with (A), at least in the case of medical technologies, by asserting that “Without pure research, medicine would not be as advanced as it is.”\n\nResponse (B) is incorrect since we can determine, based on their statements, that Laird and Kim would likely agree that pure research “expands the boundaries of our knowledge of medicine.” Laird notes that pure research provides us with new technologies that have medical applications. Kim points out that “Without pure research, medicine would not be as advanced as it is.”\n\nResponse (C) is incorrect. Kim indicates agreement that pure research “should have the saving of human lives as an important goal” since Kim’s position is that “Saving lives is what counts most of all.” Since Laird cites the saving of lives as one way in which pure research is worthwhile or valuable, Laird also indicates agreement that pure research “should have the saving of human lives as an important goal,” although Laird indicates that expanding knowledge and providing new ideas should be an even more important goal of pure research.

The executive’s remarks suggest that the ads that appeared in print and on the website were basically the same, or very similar. The executive reasoned that information about the effect of the website ads could be used as evidence for an inference about how the print ads likely performed. The executive thus used the analogy between the print ads and the website ads to infer something about the print ads. (D), therefore, is the correct response.\n\nResponse (A) is incorrect.

The passage indicates that the Quebec Bridge disaster in 1907 and the inquiry that followed caused the engineering “rules of thumb” used in construction of thousands of bridges to be abandoned. Since the Quebec Bridge disaster in 1907 prompted this abandonment, it can be inferred that these were the rules of thumb under which the Quebec Bridge was being built when it collapsed and that these were the rules of thumb used in bridge building before 1907. Further, since the Quebec Bridge collapsed while under construction and the rules of thumb being used were abandoned as a result, it can be inferred that the rules of thumb used in building the Quebec Bridge and bridges prior to 1907 were insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction. Finally, since the alternative that was adopted in place of the old engineering rules of thumb was to “depend on far more rigorous applications of mathematical analysis,” it can be inferred that the mathematical analysis incorporated in the engineering rules of thumb used prior to 1907 made them insufficient to completely assure the safety of bridges under construction. Thus, (E) is the correct response.\n\nResponse (A) is incorrect. (A) asserts that bridges built before about 1907 were unsafe for the public to use because they were built without thorough mathematical analysis. But this conclusion goes far beyond what is established by the passage. The passage gives evidence only about the safety of bridges built before 1907 while they were under construction. It is silent on whether bridges built before about 1907 were safe when open for use by the public. Moreover, the passage indicates that the rules of thumb used in bridge construction before 1907 were abandoned because the use of those rules did not provide adequate assurance of safety for bridges under construction. It does not follow that bridges built using those rules of thumb (those built before about 1907) actually were unsafe, either while under construction or when open for public use.\n\nResponse (B) is incorrect in claiming that Cooper’s absence from the construction site caused the breaking off of the cantilever. The passage does not establish that, had Cooper been at the site, he could have successfully intervened to prevent the cantilever from breaking off. By freezing the project, he might have spared lives by stopping work, but there is nothing in the passage to indicate that he necessarily would have prevented the collapse.\n\nResponse (C) is incorrect; there is no evidence in the passage about why nineteenth-century bridge engineers relied on their rules of thumb.\n\nResponse (D) is also incorrect. While the passage suggests that a more rigorous application of mathematical analysis would have prevented the collapse of the bridge, it offers no evidence that it is the only way the collapse could have been prevented. For example, it might have been prevented had corrective measures been taken in time.\n\nThis question was of medium difficulty, based on the number of test takers who answered it correctly when it appeared on the LSAT."

The argument concludes that “current theory is wrong in claiming that supernovas of a certain size always produce neutron stars” based on the observation that no evidence has been found of a neutron star left behind by the supernova event of 1987. However, the failure to find evidence of the predicted neutron star does not necessarily indicate that such evidence does not exist. It may instead indicate that the instruments used to search for the evidence are not powerful enough to detect a neutron star in the area where the 1987 supernova event occurred. The argument would thus be strengthened if there was evidence that the search instruments used would in fact be capable of finding the predicted neutron star if that star existed.\n\nResponse (B) provides such evidence. If “sensitive astronomical instruments have detected neutron stars much farther away than the location of the 1987 supernova,” then it is less likely that the predicted neutron star is outside the detection range of “the most sensitive instruments ever developed.” Thus, (B) is the correct response.\n\nResponse (A) reports that most supernova remnants that astronomers have detected have a neutron star nearby. Since (A) gives no information about the size of the supernovas that produced these remnants, it is possible that all of the remnants detected to date are consistent with the current theory’s claim that supernovas of a certain size always produce neutron stars. (A), therefore, lends no support to the argument that the current theory is wrong in this claim.\n\nResponse (C) reports that the supernova of 1987 was the first supernova that scientists were able to observe in progress. This information has no direct bearing on the question of whether this event produced a neutron star and thus cannot be used to strengthen the argument that the current theory is wrong.\n\nResponse (D) asserts that several important features of the 1987 supernova are correctly predicted by the current theory. This bolsters the support for the current theory and would thus, if anything, weaken the argument that the current theory is wrong.\n\nResponse (E) reports that not all neutron stars are the products of supernova events. Since this information pertains to neutron stars that were not produced by supernovas, it is irrelevant to the question of whether all supernovas of a certain size produce neutron stars, as the current theory claims.

The argument bases its conclusion—that democracy does not promote political freedom—on two sets of historical examples. The first set of examples demonstrates that democracy is not sufficient for political freedom, and the second set demonstrates that democracy is not necessary for political freedom. But it does not follow from these examples that democracy does not promote political freedom. Even if democracy is not, by itself, sufficient for political freedom, it can still promote political freedom by contributing to it in most instances. Even if democracy is not necessary for political freedom, it can still be true that democracy is something that promotes political freedom wherever it is found. Thus, (D) is the correct response. Response (A) is incorrect. The political scientist’s argument does not indicate that any particular conditions are necessary for political freedom, nor does it indicate that any particular conditions are sufficient to bring about political freedom. Thus the argument could not be said to confuse these two sorts of conditions. Rather, the political scientist’s argument attempts to demonstrate that democracy does not promote political freedom on the grounds that democracy is neither necessary nor sufficient for bringing about political freedom. Response (B) is incorrect. The argument does fail to consider whether a substantial increase in the level of political freedom would cause a society to become more democratic, but this does not constitute a flaw in its reasoning. The truth of the claim that increased political freedom causes greater democratization would not by itself undermine the political scientist’s conclusion that democracies do not promote political freedom. Nor does that claim engage with the argument’s premises, which are concerned with the effect of democracy on political freedom, not the effect of political freedom on democracy. Response (C) is incorrect. The “causal claim being made” could only be the argument’s conclusion that democracy does not promote political freedom, which denies that there is a causal connection between democracy and political freedom. The historical examples in the argument are relevant to this claim, however. These examples are an important part of the larger body of historical evidence that one would look to when investigating the issue of whether democracy promotes political freedom. Response (E) is also incorrect. The political scientist does not express a personal point of view or base the historical examples on such a view.

In order to balance these requirements, they have adopted a practice of selling drugs at lower prices in poorer countries. The journalist’s conclusion is that this practice is unjustified. To support this claim, the journalist points out that different individuals in the same nation have differing abilities to pay, but this consideration does not, by itself, establish that the pharmaceutical company’s policy is unjustified. The question asks you to choose the principle that would most help to justify the journalist’s reasoning.\n\nThe principle stated in response (C) connects the question of whether special consideration is deserved to personal, rather than societal, needs. The pharmaceutical companies’ practice provides special consideration based on the characteristics of one’s society, and not based on one’s personal needs. As a result, according to this principle, the practice tends to deny special consideration to some who deserve it (the poorer citizens of wealthier nations), while giving special consideration to some who do not deserve it (the middle class citizens of poorer nations). In this way the practice is failing to meet the pharmaceutical companies’ obligation to provide special consideration for those who most need the drugs and cannot afford them, and, in giving undeserved special consideration, failing to generate income that could have been used to support new drug research. The principle in (C) thereby provides strong support for the journalist’s reasoning that the pharmaceutical companies’ practice is unjustified. Thus, (C) is the correct response.\n\nThe principle stated in response (A) applies to balancing the consideration deserved by ill people and healthy people. However, the pharmaceutical companies’ practice, and the journalist’s argument against that practice, concerns only ill people (that is, people who need drugs). As a result, response (A) is not relevant to the journalist’s reasoning.\n\nThe principle stated in (B) requires that wealthy institutions use some of their resources to aid those in need. This tends to affirm the pharmaceutical companies’ moral imperative to provide medicines to those who need them but cannot afford them. However, this principle gives no support to the journalist’s reasoning, which contends that the pharmaceutical companies’ pricing policy is not justified by this moral imperative.\n\nThe principle stated in (D), that people in wealthy nations should not have better access to health care than those in poorer nations, is a principle that tends to support the companies’ practice, because the companies’ practice is one that tends to lessen the health care disparities between wealthy and poorer nations. For this reason, (D) actually runs counter to the journalist’s reasoning.\n\nThe principle stated in (E) concerns whether an unequal distribution of health care or an unequal distribution of wealth is more unfair. However, this is a different issue than the one the journalist is addressing. Response (E) is thus not relevant to the journalist’s reasoning.\n\nThis was an easy question, based on the number of test takers who answered it correctly when it appeared on the LSAT."

The conclusion of the argument is that it is false that any contemporary poet who writes formal poetry is performing a politically conservative act. To draw this conclusion logically, one only needs to show at least one contemporary poet who is writing formal poetry and is not thereby performing a politically conservative act. Showing such an instance would provide a counterexample to the claim attributed to the critics, demonstrating that the critics’ generalization is false.\n\nThe premise given is that there are two contemporary and politically progressive feminist poets who write formal poetry—Molly Peacock and Marilyn Hacker. If no one who is politically progressive is capable of performing a politically conservative act, and Peacock and Hacker are politically progressive, it follows logically that neither is capable of performing a politically conservative act. Since both write formal poetry, their writing of formal poetry cannot be a politically conservative act. This shows that one can write formal poetry without performing a politically conservative act, so (C) is the correct response.\n\nIf it is true that no one who is a feminist is politically conservative, as response (A) says, we can conclude that Peacock and Hacker, who are identified as being feminists, are not politically conservative. But we already knew this, as they were also identified as being politically progressive. As long as people who are not themselves politically conservative are capable of performing politically conservative acts, the question of whether it is possible for someone to write formal poetry without performing a politically conservative act remains unanswered. (A) is thus incorrect.\n\nIf no poet who writes unrhymed and unmetered poetry is politically conservative, as response (B) indicates, this tells us little about Peacock and Hacker, whose poetry, we are told, is almost exclusively formal. Insofar as (B) may indicate that Peacock and Hacker are not politically conservative (because they write some poetry that is not both rhymed and metered), we already knew this, as they are identified as being politically progressive. Since the argument works by presenting Peacock and Hacker as counterexamples to the claim that to write formal poetry is to perform a politically conservative act, (B) contributes nothing in the way of additional support for the conclusion.\n\nResponse (D) says that anyone who sometimes writes poetry that is not politically conservative never writes poetry that is politically conservative. However, to make the conclusion of the argument follow logically, one must show that some contemporary poets who write formal poetry are sometimes not performing a politically conservative act. The information in (D) is not applicable to this question.\n\nResponse (E) concerns the effects of the content of a poet’s work on determining the political consequences of the work. However, the question that must be answered is whether any contemporary poet who writes formal poetry is performing a politically conservative act, not what the consequences of that poetry might be. The question of whether writing a particular poem is a politically conservative act is different from the question of what that poem’s political consequences will be. Moreover, because the content of neither Peacock’s nor Hacker’s work has been specified, (E) does not even allow us to draw a conclusion about the political consequences of their work."

As long as I can make an objection, I should be good. Now, which one of the five answer choices is a question that helps us determine whether the argument is good or bad? AHuh? No. We’re talking about whether patients should take this new drug in addition to the old drug. I don’t care if there are a million other anti-osteoporosis drugs on the market or zero others. It makes no difference to whether patients should take both the old drug they were already taking and this new drug. BI don’t care. The fact is, certain immune disorder drugs have the unfortunate side effect of causing osteoporosis. That might be for reason X, Y, or Z and it has no bearing on whether patients should take both the new drug and the old drug. CI don’t care about this either. I’m wondering why the clinician is recommending both drugs, rather than one or the other. I don’t see how cost is relevant. Maybe it’s zero, maybe it’s a million bucks. That has no bearing on bone preservation itself. DNope. Maybe it’s been on the market for 100 years, maybe just one year. The fact is, there’s a new drug on the market. The length of tenure of the new drug has no bearing on whether patients would be better off taking the new drug in addition to the old one. EYup. My objection up top was related to taking the new drug on top of the old drug. If the new drug, combined with the old drug, loses its efficacy (or, like I was worried about, becomes super-effective and turns your leg bones into redwood trees) then it seems like a stupid plan to take both drugs. On the other hand, maybe the new drug plays super nice with the old drug and patients trying to avoid osteoporosis would be much better off taking both drugs instead of just one. As the answer to E changes from “not at all” to “very much,” my assessment of the clinician’s recommendation changes from “very bad” to “just fine.” That’s how I know that E is the best question to ask."

To weaken this argument, we want something that suggests that it’s not unethical to eat meat (even though it may have bad consequences). AThis doesn’t weaken the argument. Just because people prefer meat, that doesn’t mean it’s not unethical to eat it. BThe ethicist’s point was that it’s unethical to eat meat because we could instead eat the 16 pounds of grains that the animals would've eaten. But if the animals are eating grain that we can’t eat, then the ethicist’s argument doesn’t hold up. This is a great weakener. CThis strengthens the argument. It shows that we don’t need to eat meat. If we did need to eat meat for nutritional purposes, that would weaken the argument. DThere were several other reasons to stop eating meat, not just disappearing farmland. So this doesn’t really weaken the argument. What about the expanding population? Shouldn’t we stop eating meat because of that? EI don’t care what nutritionists think. They could be wrong. Or they could be right, but it could still be unethical to eat meat. Meat and grain are not the only categories of food. There’s dairy, nuts, vegetables, and fruit.

We’re asked to strengthen that claim. With these Strengthen questions, we’re generally looking for one of two things. We either want to show that the argument follows logically from the premises, or we want to defend the argument against some counterargument. Here are my predictions for this question: 1) “When species branch into two distinct populations, it’s often/always because they have adapted to their environments.” 2) ‘An answer that rejects any number of potential counterarguments like, “neither of the sockeye populations was tested by scientists in ways that would alter their genetics.” AGreat answer, right off the bat. A devastating weakener to this logic might have been, “No, dummy—they didn’t ‘adapt genetically’ to their deep-water or shallow-water environments; it’s just that some of them started mating with the native salmon in the lake, thereby becoming genetically distinct from the ones that didn’t.” I didn’t predict this attack, but when reading this answer, I’m like “oh dang—this answer defends the argument against that attack.” This is a defensive strengthened. As long as I can eliminate B–E, this will be the answer. BI don’t see how this explains why this new species is genetically distinct. It says the native species had two distinct populations. This native species might have been distinct because they, themselves, adapted to the environment of the lake. We just don’t know. In order to make B a strengthener at all, we have to assume that the native species were genetically distinct not because of their environment. We don’t have enough information to assume that. Even if we did assume that, we don’t care about the old native species. They could have genetically distinct for any number of reasons, and that wouldn’t say anything about the new sockeye salmon. The researchers didn’t make a case for why the native salmon were distinct, just the new sockeyes. CWho cares? This does nothing to change the argument. Think about it this way. If most salmon didn’t spend time in the deep and shallow ends of the lake, would that weaken the researchers’ argument? Not at all, since what we’re concerned with is these new sockeyes. We want to know why these sockeyes are genetically distinct. DThis is the opposite of what we’re looking for. If one of the sockeye species is virtually identical to the originals from 1940, then one of the sockeyes didn’t genetically change. And if one of the sockeyes didn’t genetically change, they didn’t adapt to their environment. If anything, this weakens the argument. EWe don’t care about the total number of salmon. Numbers of salmon don’t have anything to do with why the two populations of sockeyes are genetically distinct. In a Strengthen question, stronger is better, but none of the other answers do anything to strengthen the researchers’ argument. A isn’t an offensive strengthener that helps the argument prove its conclusion based on the facts, but it’s still the best answer because at least it defends the argument against the attack of “how do you know some of them didn’t just get it on with the local salmon.” Since A defends the argument against one potentially devastating problem, A is our answer."

After all, balanced muscle development is needed to maintain a healthy back, since the muscles on opposite sides of the spine must pull equally in opposing directions to keep the back in proper alignment and protect the spine. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? A Muscles on opposite sides of the spine that are equally well developed will be enough to keep the back in proper alignment. B Exercising the muscles on opposite sides of the spine unequally tends to lead to unbalanced muscle development. C Provided that one exercises the muscles on opposite sides of the spine equally, one will have a generally healthy back. D If the muscles on opposite sides of the spine are exercised unequally, one’s back will be irreparably damaged. E One should exercise daily to ensure that the muscles on opposite sides of the spine keep the back in proper alignment."

                "content": "So, the argument says that exercising opposite sides of the back equally is important to maintain a healthy back because balanced muscle development is needed to maintain a healthy back. This argument requires, “Exercising opposite sides of the back unequally will lead to unbalanced muscle development” to connect the two premises together. AThis confuses sufficient for necessary. The argument says you need to develop muscles on both sides equally to maintain a healthy back, but it doesn’t say that’s all you need to do for a healthy back. Someone could have equally well-developed muscles but have poor posture or something that leads to an unhealthy back. BThis is exactly what we’re looking for. Put into the original argument, and it reads as such, “Exercising opposite sides of the back equally is important because exercising them unequally leads to unbalanced muscle development.” And balanced muscle development is needed to maintain a healthy back. CThis is wrong for the same reason as A. Proper muscle development is necessary for a healthy back, but the argument never says that this will guarantee a healthy back. It says if you don’t have balanced muscles, you won’t have a healthy back. This doesn’t mean if you do have balanced muscles, you will have a healthy back. Other factors can affect the health of your spine. DWoah, the argument never says anything about irreparable damage. The argument doesn’t need this. EAgain, the argument doesn’t say anything about daily exercise. It doesn’t even say that you should exercise to get a healthy back, just that when you do exercise, do it equally. The answer is B."

If “most” of them attended every class, then at least six of them did. And maybe four did not. And if “each” student who got lower than a B- (which is a C+ or lower) missed at least one class, then those six students who attended every class must have gotten a B- or higher. This does not mean, however, that the four slackers got a C+ or lower. Some of them did, but not necessarily all of them. That’d be a false contrapositive. The word “each” means “if,” so this last sentence is saying “if C+ or lower, then not attend all classes.” The contrapositive is “if attend all classes, then not C+ or lower (in other words, then B- or higher).” We don’t know what happens if you don’t attend all the classes. AWe don’t know anything about the A students. Maybe there are none. Wrong. BSome of them did, but not necessarily “most” of them. This is the false contrapositive issue. CThis plays off of the wording in the passage “lower than B minus,” which means C+ or lower. So maybe all the students who came every time got a B-. Wrong. DMaybe all of the four slackers got C+ or lower. It doesn’t have to be true, but it could be true. EWe know that “most” attended all the classes. And that if you attended all of them, you did not get a grade “lower than B minus,” so this must be true. Correct."

Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the editorialist’s statements? A Particular acts of resident participation would be likely to elicit a positive response from local politicians if those politicians were less isolated from their electorate. B Local political business should be conducted less secretively because this would avoid discouraging resident participation in local politics.

The leap in logic is “if we have a lower chance of a positive official response, we’re less likely to participate.” Is that true? I mean, maybe it is. But on the LSAT we need to make our arguments explicit. This argument just assumed that we’re less likely to participate when there’s a lower chance of a “positive official response.” What does that even mean? What if we got a positive unofficial response? Wouldn’t that work too? Why do we need a “Positive official response”? This is a Must Be True question, so we accept everything above and pick something that’s been justified by those statements. Here, I think the correct answer will be the necessary assumption I’ve already been talking about above. If we’re to buy the conclusion “less likely to participate” then it MUST be true that we’re less likely to participate when there’s a lower chance of an official response. AThis answer is wrong because there’s a difference between “likely” and “more likely.” This answer says it’s “likely” that there would be a positive response, which means more than 50%. That’s just not justified by the facts—the facts said “more likely,” which might be an increased chance from 1% to 2%, but still “unlikely”—so this is out. BNo, the problem here is “should.” The argument said nothing about what “should” be the case—only what is. CNah. We don’t know what other factors might be at play. DWell, sure. This isn’t what I predicted, but this is a necessary step in the argument. The argument started with “news rarely covers local politics thoroughly… which has the effect of isolating” (which in turn, discourages residents from participating). So this answer must be true. More thorough coverage, less discouragement from participating. This is the answer. EThis answer confuses cause for effect so it’s out. The answer is D because, even though it didn’t match my prediction, I can see that it must be true if everything in the argument is true."

And sure enough, that’s exactly what I find. The third sentence is a reason why the second sentence is true. In other words, it’s a “premise.” This premise supports the second sentence. If we rearranged the second and third sentences, and added “because” and “therefore,” it would sound like this: “Because attempts to increase productivity decrease the number of employees, which clearly harms the dismissed employees as well as the sense of security of the retained employees, therefore not all efforts to increase productivity are beneficial to the business as a whole.” It’s a very simple argument, with one premise and one conclusion. Because the third sentence supports the second sentence, the second sentence is the conclusion of the argument. A and C are misstatements of the argument. D is background information that has no bearing on the logic. E is a premise in support of the argument’s main conclusion, which is B."
