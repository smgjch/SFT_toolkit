Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers' decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that _____\n Which choice most logically completes the text?\n Options: A.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option B. Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues' count and Bianchi and Morri's count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's study.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.&nbsp;\n"

Rationale: Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Lowell describes an element of nature as an active participant in the experience of a nighttime scene on a body of water. The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reflects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene. \nChoice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines—the waves—isn't portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn't present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation presents an image of an element of nature—the moon—it doesn't mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but instead as static or unchanging ('ever and always the same&rdquo;). \n"

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama's books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that's peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi's eyes as 'glowing&rdquo; and states that she 'devoured the scene,&rdquo; suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. \nChoice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as 'looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures&rdquo; in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she's unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text's description of the image and Heidi's other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as 'splendid&rdquo; and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi's eyes as 'glowing&rdquo; and states that she 'devoured the scene,&rdquo; suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it's unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep. \n"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option A. Rationale: Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the relative appeal of different kinds of plays by Shakespeare to today's audiences. According to the text, Shakespeare's tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today's audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of Romeo and Juliet, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare's time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare's history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare's history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. \nChoice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare's tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare's tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren't mentioned, there's no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare's tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today's audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible to today's audiences, it doesn't suggest that Romeo and Juliet is more accessible than Shakespeare's other tragedies. Rather, the text presents Romeo and Juliet as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare's tragedies hold continued appeal for today's readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare's history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare's other works. \n"

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it presents the finding that, if true, would best support Suarez, P&eacute;rez-Huerta, and Harrell's claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suarez, P&eacute;rez-Huerta, and Harrell's research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers' claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. \nChoice A is incorrect because finding that it's easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn't support the researchers' claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn't give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers' claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn't weaken the researchers' claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn't provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers' claim. \n"

The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author's own explanation of the poem.

According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn't learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn't invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. \nChoice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers' crops were ill suited to the techniques, it's unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benefits of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benefits of the techniques much later. \n"

The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. &nbsp;Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees' sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects.&nbsp;\nChoice B is incorrect.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option A. Rationale: Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros's The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros's novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character's youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. \nChoice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn't limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren't Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella's influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren't Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn't relate directly to the text's claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros's The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros's novella, such similarities wouldn't necessarily be evidence of the novella's influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella's influence.&nbsp;\n"

Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues' conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues' conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers' conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes.

However, the finding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. \nChoice B is incorrect because the finding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn't offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option B. Rationale: Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers' conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for \"an extended time,\" that supports the \"wet and warm scenario\" on Mars, which involved a \"prolonged\" period of temperate conditions (and not just a \"brief period of melting\").\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice doesn't provide support for the researchers' conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that's the evidence that would support the \"wet and warm\" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers' conclusions, but rather the opposite. A \"massive but short lived influx\" of liquid water is not the same as a \"prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions.\" It more reflects the opposing theory, a \"brief period of melting.\" Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb's conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars (\"wet and warm\" and \"brief period of melting\") involve flowing water, but lava isn't mentioned at all in the text. Therefore, this choice doesn't provide exclusive support for either theory.\n"

The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals' domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team's analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet—importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle's diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team's conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops—and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans. \nChoice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep's and goats' diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option C. Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of scholars' understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn't have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don't otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn't produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn't have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn't have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars' mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren't very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn't have marketplaces, it wouldn't lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don't already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn't already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn't trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn't have any need for marketplaces. The scholars' mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products. \n"

Although the text states that Wang and his team identified fossilized remains of a mixopterid species that lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn't indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a more recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn't suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team confirmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the team's fossil established the presence of mixopterids on Gondwana, not on Laurussia. Moreover, the text only discusses the fossil in relation to the geographical distribution of mixopterids, not in relation to their evolution. \n"

Rationale: Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the researchers' claim that they found evidence that experiencing awe can make people feel more connected to others and thus more likely to behave altruistically (with beneficial and unselfish concern for others). According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers' claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. \nChoice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn't address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn't serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn't help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true—that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn't necessarily beneficial on its own and isn't the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn't support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. \n"

The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren't iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If participants located most of the purple or blue wings but far fewer of the iridescent wings, that finding would support the team's idea since it would suggest that noniridescent wings are easier to see than iridescent wings. \nChoice B is incorrect because if participants located the iridescent wings more quickly than the purple or blue wings, that finding would weaken the team's idea, not support the team's idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings were easier to see than the noniridescent wings.

The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there's a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don't have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn't leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster's hypothesis.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn't weaken Foster's hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn't be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn't undermine Foster's hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster's hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn't reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster's hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.&nbsp;\n"

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain's other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony's exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next. Choice D is incorrect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican dialect of Spanish is different from others, it does not discuss how speakers of different dialects are able to understand each other. \n"

The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants' medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations' lands. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages.

The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn't used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn't have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn't have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn't have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. \nChoice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn't available until the early 1900s doesn't imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn't have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn't have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn't preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge—and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers—of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn't used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn't have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn't indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s.

But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superficial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, much of her music also reflects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre's greatest songs, and they generally don't require much digging to reveal.\n What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre?\n Options: A. It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre's songs.\n B. It evolved over time from a superficial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns.\n C. It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres.\n D. It gave rise to a Black women's musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century.\n"

As the text explains, Gibson, who is Cherokee and Choctaw, transforms punching bags into art pieces by applying (or attaching) to them beadwork and elements of Native dressmaking, including leather fringe and the jingles of the jingle dress. The text goes on to say that in most Native communities, the art forms of beadwork and dressmaking are traditionally practiced by women. Therefore, Gibson's approach to art consists of creating original works by drawing from traditional Native art forms.\nChoice B is incorrect. Because Gibson incorporates Native art forms into his own original artwork, it can be inferred that he has been influenced by other Native artists, but the text never suggests that non-Native artists have influenced him. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that Gibson designs dresses influenced by boxing but instead that he turns punching bags, which are used in boxing, into works of art by applying elements of Native dressmaking to them. Choice D is incorrect.

In a 2022 study, herpetologist Atsushi Kurabayashi and his team investigated HT in multicellular organisms—namely, snakes and frogs in Madagascar. The team detected BovB—a gene transmitted vertically in snakes—in many frog species. The apparent direction of gene transfer seems counterintuitive because frogs usually don't survive encounters with snakes and so wouldn't be able to transmit the newly acquired gene to offspring, but the team concluded that BovB is indeed transmitted from snakes to frogs, either directly or indirectly, via HT.\n Which finding, if true, would most directly support the team's conclusion?\n Options: A.

And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from 'Odalie&rdquo; to illustrate the claim that Odalie is eager to escape the monotony, or tedious lack of variety, of her everyday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling 'shut up&rdquo; and complains that she has 'no companions&rdquo; except for her 'sleepy tante.&rdquo; Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is 'dull&rdquo; and she is 'ready for any new sensation,&rdquo; meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life. \nChoice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word 'tiresome,&rdquo; which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie's negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn't express that Odalie's everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn't express that Odalie's everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has 'quaint windows&rdquo; and a 'green and cool&rdquo; courtyard that is 'made musical&rdquo; by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes the lively sounds of a Mardi Gras celebration that Odalie hears through her window, not the monotony of Odalie's everyday life or her wish to escape. \n"

The narrator describes the view he and his companions have from the balloon: the earth lies beneath \"milky vapors,\" and the balloon itself looks like another moon. The narrator goes on to explain how the people riding in the balloon are affected by the ride, explaining that they are immersed in the experience: floating along in \"delicious inertia,\" or inactivity, like \"silent, joyous, irresponsible beings.\" Thus, the main idea is that the narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon.\nChoice A is incorrect because the narrator never describes himself as feeling isolated from his companions; instead, he characterizes riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them. And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is isolation from those on the ground, as when he says of himself and his companions, \"We are now alone.\" Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn't suggest that he or his companions are troubled by the effects of the balloon ride. Instead, he describes himself and his companions as \"joyous\" and the experience of floating in the balloon as \"delicious.\" Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator is surprised by his companions' response to the balloon ride. In fact, the text indicates that the narrator and his companions are having the same experience: they're described as \"silent\" and \"motionless,\" rather than as having unrestrained enthusiasm.\n"

Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student's claim about the film One Night in Miami&hellip;. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn't have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn't discuss Powers's approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn't initially plan to write a story only 'focusing on the meeting itself&rdquo; but rather had considered writing a 'much longer&rdquo; and more expansive work about the meeting's four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn't discuss Powers's approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film's positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn't specify to what extent Powers's representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened.

Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues' conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru's Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues' conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth's hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues' claim.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues' conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues' conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues' conclusion, not strengthen it.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of accelerated flowering in A. thaliana plants. The text indicates that A. thaliana plants show accelerated flowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated flowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of A. thaliana plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn't show accelerated flowering. The team then compared these modified plants to A. thaliana plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in flowering at 22&deg; Celsius, but at 27&deg; Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated flowering while the plants without ELF3 didn't. If accelerated flowering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive flowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of flowering is unique to A. thaliana. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There's nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana&nbsp;varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the flowering of modified and unmodified A. thaliana plants at 22&deg; Celsius, there's no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to flower at 22&deg; Celsius; the text doesn't mention a specific temperature threshold required for A. thaliana flowering. \n"

The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls' chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls.

There's no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks.

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text's discussion of Andr&eacute; Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues' computer simulations of our solar system's development. The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth's real size, it's reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring's formation was important in determining Earth's eventual size.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn't indicate that this was an initial simulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring's formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets' eventual size in the researchers' simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring's formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system's planets.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers' hypothesis about the plants' dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers' hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorous—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don't benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don't have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit. \nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn't suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There's no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers' hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn't actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks. \n"

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of Ancestral Puebloans' migration to the Rio Grande Valley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices—including the farming of turkeys—to their new home. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley's terrain to that of Mesa Verde's terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Although genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande valley descended in part from the turkey population raised by the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde before their migration to the valley in 1280, this finding doesn't eliminate the possibility that Indigenous peoples living in the valley before 1280 might also have farmed turkeys. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region—the Rio Grande Valley—after 1280. \n"

The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually 'an honest signal&rdquo; (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven't consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren't necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager's appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird's overall fitness.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers' feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it's true, regardless of whether it's actually true.

The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they're social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues' experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren't social and don't practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn't social and doesn't practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn't be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don't practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening.

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to active multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes' antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team's discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. \nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes' antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes. \n"

The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes's poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes's book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specifically note that the work is a 'beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,&rdquo; then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets.

In other words, US legislators looked to the BBC as a model, taking direct inspiration from it when they created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. \nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation provides historical information about the BBC, not information about the inspiration for the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR. This quotation, therefore, is irrelevant to the student's claim that the BBC inspired the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation contrasts the lack of competition faced by the BBC with the substantial competition faced by NPR, which has no bearing on the student's claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the BBC.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because this quotation focuses on a common belief among US politicians that inspired Congress's embrace of publicly funded broadcasting. The quotation doesn't say anything about the BBC and therefore doesn't support the claim that the BBC inspired Congress to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. \n"

If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison's time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House's published authors, thus supporting the scholar's claim. \nChoice B is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company's list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison's novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn't show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist.

The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn't make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss. \n"

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that would best support Granito and &Aacute;lvarez's claim that fermenting black beans makes them easier to digest and more nutritious. The text indicates that high levels of soluble fiber and raffinose in black beans make the beans hard to digest and that tannins and trypsin inhibitors make it harder for the body to extract nutrients from the beans. If it were found that fermenting the beans significantly reduces their levels of soluble fiber, raffinose, trypsin inhibitors, and tannins when cooked, this would directly support the claim that fermentation improves the digestibility of the beans and makes them more nutritious. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that trypsin inhibitors and tannins interfere with the body's ability to extract nutrients from black beans; if fermentation and cooking were found to increase these antinutrients, fermented beans would likely be less nutritious than unfermented ones, not more nutritious (as Granito and &Aacute;lvarez claim). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't address the idea that greater nitrogen absorption in the gut has an effect on a food's digestibility or level of nutrition, so the discovery of the presence of microorganisms that may increase nitrogen absorption wouldn't provide relevant support for the claim that fermentation makes black beans easier to digest and more nutritious. Choice D is incorrect because Granito and &Aacute;lvarez's claim focuses on the effect of fermenting black beans, but the finding that nonfermented black beans also have fewer trypsin inhibitors and tannins when cooked at high pressure would suggest that the role of the cooking method could be significant when it comes to nutrition; further, the finding wouldn't address the beans' digestibility. \n"

As presented in the text, St&ouml;ger and her team's claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication.

The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can—a finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won't be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren't able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers' claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. \nChoice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers' claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists' work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn't support the researchers' claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models.

It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin's sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to 'new analysis,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood. \n"

Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"unified vision\" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the \"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\nChoice A is incorrect. \"Proficient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they're not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it's actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a \"unified vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).\n"

The text begins with the underlined question, 'How lifelike are they?&rdquo; The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren't portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film's unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. \nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films' unique stories and aren't necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience's reactions to characters in animated films. \n"

The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren't certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don't have enough information about the star's internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse's internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn't be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn't.\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues' conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn't indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn't address this information at all.\n"

At the start of the text, Jane says, 'I went on with my day's business tranquilly,&rdquo; indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is 'involuntarily framing advertisements&rdquo; (meaning that she can't stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new 'situations&rdquo; (or jobs) would be like.&nbsp;\nChoice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane's feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane's thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying—she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she 'should&rdquo; quit her current job (indicating that she hasn't yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts 'might germinate and bear fruit if they could,&rdquo; meaning that the thoughts haven't yet led to a decision—that Jane isn't yet determined to get a new job somewhere else. \n"

Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s.

A change in Earth's orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists' livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert.\n\n<strong>Text 2</strong>\n\nResearch by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara's desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region's humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option D. Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer's team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer's team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn't appear to contain any life. Fierer's team says that though this doesn't conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it's unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer's team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer's team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer's team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. \nChoice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer's team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn't appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer's team wouldn't argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn't compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer's team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn't detect them, but the author doesn't speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer's team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. \n"

Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don't adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.\n Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu (Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1?\n Options: A. As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts\n B. As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had\n C. As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres\n D.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how Putirka and Xu (Text 2) would likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth's once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth's continental crust. \nChoice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is.

The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O'Brien and Ahmed's study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O'Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O'Brien and Ahmed's study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O'Brien and Ahmed's study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture's effects on cognition.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses O'Brien and Ahmed's study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture's effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O'Brien and Ahmed's study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O'Brien and Ahmed's findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture's effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture's effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O'Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O'Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.\n"

But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span>\n\nIn 2015, physicists Tiago Batalh&atilde;o et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment 'does not pinpoint&nbsp;... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,&rdquo; coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.\n Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?\n Options: A. It would suggest an interesting direction for future research were it not the case that two of the physicists who conducted the experiment disagree on the significance of its findings.\n B. It provides empirical evidence that the current understanding of an aspect of physics at a microscopic level must be incomplete.\n C. It is consistent with the current understanding of physics at a microscopic level but not at a macroscopic level.\n D. It supports a claim about an isolated system of atoms in a laboratory, but that claim should not be extrapolated to a general claim about the universe.\n"

Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can't solve: at a microscopic level, the 'laws of physics&rdquo; suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn't explain why. This supports Author 1's point that physicists still don't fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised. \nChoice A is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests.

This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. \nChoice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows 'refinements of,&rdquo; or improvements on, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it's possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn't discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, the Tikal citadel's builders improved on it.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing 'precursors of&rdquo; Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuac&aacute;n. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, then the Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn't make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there's no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people's 'animosities toward,&rdquo; or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;\n"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option C. Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif's study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. \nChoice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others. \n"

Rationale: Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California's coast.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways. The text is more focused on the railroad's control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California's railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad's \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position.\n"

Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits' survival. \nChoice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn't make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying.

Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium's development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text's author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. \nChoice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers—namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members—the author doesn't explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television—namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text—video games—rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear. \n"

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because the text's focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn't accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians' approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas. \n"

The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in 'the metropolis&rdquo;: he's excited and 'wild with enthusiasm.&rdquo; He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn't as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe's reaction to a new environment. \nChoice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there's no explanation provided for the move.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people's houses—but there's no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home.

The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole's passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole's excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. \nChoice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling 'indifference to&rdquo; his two passions wouldn't make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn't care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn't be his passions at all.

The text's use of the word 'culminates&rdquo; indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole's passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing.

The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city's Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco's artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. \nChoice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn't specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as 'a living showcase of San Francisco's artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. \n"

In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. \nChoice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'endure&rdquo; can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn't have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can't persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others' absences, not on her treatment of others. \n"

Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator's experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces. \nChoice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she's had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although 'no one seemed to know&rdquo; strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that 'no one seemed to know the origin&rdquo; of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ 'widely&rdquo; and likens them to 'two separate worlds,&rdquo; these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator's feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them. \n"

Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees' willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn.

The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius's helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood's roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text's many examples of Julius's usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't portray either the narrator's or his wife's reaction to their new home.

Text 1 characterizes this discovery as 'especially promising&rdquo; and a sign of 'exciting progress&rdquo; in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR's function in humans isn't yet known, it's likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1's enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava's team's observations about EGR in humans. \nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven't yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn't say that Text 1's excitement is reasonable for the stated reason.

The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn't have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. \nChoice A is incorrect because 'admired&rdquo; means respected and approved of.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan's findings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn't benefit customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta's argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices.\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn't indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience \"efficiency gains\" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there's no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers.

The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France's Jura region, which is far from Rome.

The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is 'aeolian transport.&rdquo; The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. \nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn't present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the text.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn't refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them. Rather, the underlined portion introduces the scientific term 'aeolian transport,&rdquo; which is used in the discussion that follows.&nbsp;\n"

The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they're foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don't behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter 'patches of low species richness&rdquo;—that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species—they'll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don't behave as some models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homogeneous.&nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are 'depleted,&rdquo; or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn't indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there's no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are 'immature,&rdquo; or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models' predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species.

Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific. Thus, <span role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Referenced Content\"> Polynesian peoples, not later Europeans, probably first introduced chickens to South America.  </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<span aria-level=\"2\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span>\n\nAn Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by confirming that the mutation identified by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin.\n Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?\n Options: A. By broadly agreeing with the claim but objecting that the timeline it presupposes conflicts with the findings of the genetic analysis conducted by Storey's team\n B. By faulting the claim for implying that domestic animals couldn't have been transferred from South America to the Polynesian Islands as well\n C. By critiquing the claim for being based on an assumption that before the European invasion of South America, the chickens of Europe were genetically uniform\n D.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option D. Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say '[m]ore recently&rdquo; Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but 'that European breeds lack,&rdquo; which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira's evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey's evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues' evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey's evidence is. \nChoice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from '1321&ndash;1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region&rdquo; and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey's account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey's conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.&nbsp;\n"

Then the last sentence states that the house was 'wide open to the long-expected guest,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne's anticipation and Martha's activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage.

Rationale: Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, 'abrupt&rdquo; means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains' entry into the fossil record was sudden. \nChoice A is incorrect. Although the word 'explosion&rdquo; appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was 'catastrophic,&rdquo; or disastrous. In context, 'explosion&rdquo; refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is 'elusive,&rdquo; or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as 'imminent,&rdquo; or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago. \n"

The text begins by noting that Anne 'reveled in the world of color about her&rdquo;—that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped 'aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as 'messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne's appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn't show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla's disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne's personality. \n"

The text describes Mary's surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there's \"a little wind.\" To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word \"rough\" with a description of the wind blowing in \"delightful little gusts,\" suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all.\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \"rough\" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn't mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, \"delightful little gusts,\" which suggests that the use of \"rough\" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn't \"basic,\" or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in \"delightful little gusts.\" Choice D is incorrect because the word \"vague\" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.\n"

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as \"a void\" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature's \"surging life is at its full\" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be \"a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.\" The speaker says further that during summer, \"feeling sleeps / Gathering strength\" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn't characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when \"feeling\" gathers \"strength for efforts yet to come.\" Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time \"when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,\" it doesn't discuss the season's relationship to the speaker's memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"void\" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn't portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker.\n"

On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Text 2</strong>\n\nA new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.\n Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?\n Options: A.

The first two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. \nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't address the topic of the soil's tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn't describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. &nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identifies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil. \n"

The text first provides Alice's reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel's narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice's plan is that it can be easily arranged. \nChoice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice's plan can be arranged, and it wouldn't make sense to say that it can be arranged 'faintly,&rdquo; or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word 'hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice's plan was made in haste, the text doesn't focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan's seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as 'the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to it as 'excellent&rdquo; and 'neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged.

Rationale: Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text's discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey \"can persist across centuries and continents.\"\nChoice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn't indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis.

The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world's current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide—a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Text 2</strong></span>\n\nWhile Strassburg's team's findings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benefits of rewilding, it's important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming.\n Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view Strassburg's team's study?\n Options: A.

Rationale: Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers' perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn't be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues' perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it's the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they're unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn't argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals' curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.\n"

Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a 'stable and well nourished&rdquo; population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at 'great risk of extinction&rdquo; by the end of the century. \nChoice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures.

This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the work involved in calculating Coordinated Universal Time.\n"

The subject of the verb is 'Lincoln,&rdquo; and the first sentence tells us that we're talking about something that Abraham Lincoln did in 1860. So the simple past tense 'leveraged&rdquo; fits the logic of the text. \nChoice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. 'Has leveraged&rdquo; is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals' talents in 1860—it's definitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn't appropriate. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. 'Is leveraging&rdquo; is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals' talents in 1860, so the present tense isn't appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. 'Will leverage&rdquo; is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals' talents in 1860, so the future tense isn't appropriate. \n"

It's conventional to use a semicolon to separate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after '2009&rdquo; is conventionally used to separate the first item ('the world's&hellip;2009&rdquo;) and the second item ('an online&hellip;2010&rdquo;) in the series of things that Hinson helped create. Further, the comma after 'Basic&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after 'app,&rdquo; and the comma after 'network&rdquo; correctly pairs with the comma after 'TV&rdquo; to set off the supplemental elements ('Chickasaw Basic&rdquo; and 'Chickasaw TV&rdquo;) that provide the names of the app and the TV network, respectively. Altogether, the punctuation in this choice results in a sentence that clearly indicates that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. &nbsp;\nChoice A is incorrect because it fails to punctuate the complex series in a way that makes clear that Hinson helped make a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015.
