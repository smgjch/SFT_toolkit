It has long been thought that humans first crossed a land bridge into the Americas approximately 13,000 years ago. ______ based on radiocarbon dating of samples uncovered in Mexico, a research team recently suggested that humans may have arrived more than 30,000 years ago—much earlier than previously thought.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. As a result, B. Similarly, C. However, D. In conclusion,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “However” logically signals that the theory discussed in this sentence—that humans may have arrived in the Americas over 30,000 years ago—contrasts with the previously discussed theory that humans arrived around 13,000 years ago.  

Choice A is incorrect because “as a result” illogically signals that the theory in this sentence is the result of the theory discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one. Choice B is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the theory in this sentence is similar to the theory discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one. Choice D is incorrect because “in conclusion” illogically signals that the theory in this sentence concludes or summarizes the discussion of the previous theory. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one.

Researchers believe that pieces of hull found off Oregon’s coast are from a Spanish cargo ship that was lost in 1697. Stories passed down among the area’s Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians support this belief. ______ Siletz stories describe how blocks of beeswax, an item the ship had been carrying, began washing ashore after the ship was lost.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. For this reason, B. For example, C. However, D. Likewise,  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “For example” logically signals that the Siletz beeswax stories mentioned in this sentence are examples consistent with the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory.  

Choice A is incorrect because “for this reason” illogically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax were caused by the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim. Choice C is incorrect because “however” illogically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax contrast with the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim. Choice D is incorrect because “likewise” illogically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax are similar to the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim.

Before the 1847 introduction of the US postage stamp, the cost of postage was usually paid by the recipient of a letter rather than the sender, and recipients were not always able or willing to pay promptly. ______ collecting this fee could be slow and arduous, and heaps of unpaid-for, un deliverable mail piled up in post offices.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Regardless, B. On the contrary, C. Consequently, D. For example,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “Consequently” logically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence (slow fee collection, heaps of un deliverable mail) were a consequence of the fee system described in the previous sentence.  

Choice A is incorrect because “regardless” illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence occurred despite the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system. Choice B is incorrect because “on the contrary” illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence contrast with the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system. Choice D is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence are an example of the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system.

A potter choosing which type of clay to use for a piece considers two key factors: the desired look of the piece and its intended use. ______ earthenware clay is often used for decorative pieces because of its rustic look. This type of clay is not often used in industrial settings, though, because it is less durable than other clays.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In other words, B. Regardless, C. In conclusion, D. For example,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The previous sentence tells us that potters think about the look and use of a piece when selecting clay. This sentence provides a specific example of a type of clay selected for its appearance, so the transition "for example" fits perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea. But this sentence does more than just restate the previous idea. Instead, it provides a more specific example of the idea presented in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both sentences suggest that desired look plays a role in the selection of clay types for pottery pieces. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a concluding transition. But this sentence doesn’t sum up the previous sentence. Instead, it gives a specific example of the idea presented in the previous sentence.

In Gothic architecture, flying buttresses are large arches that help support a building’s exterior walls. Before the Gothic era, cathedrals’ heavy ceilings had to be supported by thick, short walls, but the invention of flying buttresses eliminated this need. ______ Gothic cathedrals could be built with thinner, higher walls.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Similarly, B. For instance, C. Nevertheless, D. As a result,  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. “As a result” logically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence were a result of the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence.  

Choice A is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence are similar to the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence. Instead, the walls were a result of that invention. Choice B is incorrect because “for instance” illogically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence are an example supporting the statement about the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence. Instead, the walls were a result of that invention. Choice C is incorrect because “nevertheless” illogically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence occurred despite the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence. Instead, the walls were a result of that invention.

Tyrian purple was a highly prized dye among the Phoenicians (an ancient civilization located in present-day Lebanon). The Phoenicians were famous for using this natural dye to color their clothes a distinctive purple. ______ the name “Phoenicia” itself, some historians claim, may have originally meant “land of purple.”  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In fact, B. Regardless, C. Lastly, D. On the contrary,  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. “In fact” logically signals that the claim in this sentence—Phoenicia being named after the color purple—emphasizes and supports the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye.  

Choice B is incorrect because “regardless” illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia’s name contrasts with the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye. Instead, the naming emphasizes and supports this claim. Choice C is incorrect because “lastly” illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia’s name is the final step in a process or sequence. Instead, the naming emphasizes and supports the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye. Choice D is incorrect because “on the contrary” illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia’s name directly opposes the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye. Instead, the naming emphasizes and supports this claim.

As a young historian in the 1950s, Alixa Naff began interviewing fellow Arab American immigrants about their experiences straddling two cultures. Over the next few decades, Naff conducted more than 450 such interviews, also known as oral histories. ______ she collected photographs and other artifacts that represented her subjects’ experiences.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In other words, B. On the contrary, C. In addition, D. Today,  

ID: 1b219d14 Answer  

Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. "In addition" logically signals that Naff’s artifact collecting was separate from, and in addition to, her interviewing.  

Choice A is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information about Naff’s artifact collecting restates the previous information about her interviewing. Instead, Naff collected artifacts in addition to conducting interviews. Choice B is incorrect because "on the contrary" illogically signals that Naff’s artifact collecting was contrary to her interviewing. Instead, Naff collected artifacts in addition to conducting interviews. Choice D is incorrect because "today" illogically signals that Naff’s artifact collecting is occurring in the present day. Instead, this activity occurred in the past, as indicated by the past tense verb "collected."

In June, female loggerhead sea turtles will swim back to the sandy beaches where they were born to lay eggs of their own. First, the turtle will dig her nest in the sand. ______ she will lay up to 100 eggs in the nest. Finally, she will cover it all with sand, before returning to the ocean.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. By contrast, B. Similarly, C. Next, D. For example,  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “Next” logically signals that the egg laying in this sentence is the next step in the sequence of events described in the other sentences.  

Choice A is incorrect because “by contrast” illogically signals that the egg laying in this sentence contrasts with the nest digging in the previous sentence. Instead, the egg laying follows the nest digging as the next step in the sequence of events. Choice B is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the egg laying in this sentence is similar to the nest digging in the previous sentence. Though the two actions are related, they are not similar. Instead, the egg laying follows the nest digging as the next step in the sequence of events. Choice D is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the egg laying in this sentence is an example of the nest digging in the previous sentence. Instead, the egg laying follows the nest digging as the next step in the sequence of events.  


# ID: b7571c0a  

Practical movie effects, such as the use of actual locations in a film, provide a more realistic visual experience than computer-generated imagery (CGI) does, but giving audiences the “real thing” can be prohibitively expensive. ______ many filmmakers use a blended approach, employing practical effects whenever possible and CGI elements as necessary to control costs.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Similarly, B. For this reason, C. Furthermore, D. In other words,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “For this reason” has the same meaning as “therefore.” .  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “Similarly” doesn’t show cause and effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing idea. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “Furthermore” doesn’t show cause and effect: it shows the addition of another agreeing idea. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like “therefore.” “In other words” doesn’t show cause and effect: it shows a restatement of the same idea in different words.

In the 1850s, William Still was instrumental in helping nearly 1,000 people escape from slavery, earning him the moniker “the Father of the Underground Railroad.” ______ despite the fame of his contributions during his lifetime, Still is discussed far less today than other prominent Black abolitionists from his era, such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. For example, B. However, C. Specifically, D. Similarly,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. "However" is used to indicate a contrast between two ideas. The first sentence describes how Still used to be famous. This sentence describes how Still is not very famous today, so the transition "however" fits perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example. But the second sentence doesn’t provide a specific example of Still’s famous contributions to the Underground Railroad. Instead, it changes the subject to how his fame has faded over time. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example or continuation of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn’t provide a specific example of Still’s famous contributions to the Underground Railroad. Instead, it changes the subject to how his fame has faded over time. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the agreement between two ideas. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence—namely, that Still used to be very famous but now isn’t very famous.

In 2018, Kurt Luther and Vikram Mohanty created the web-based tool Civil War Photo Sleuth (CWPS). A user uploading an unknown Civil War soldier’s photograph to CWPS first tags the photo with all known information. ______ CWPS’s facial-recognition software analyzes twenty-seven different physical features and looks for matches to tagged images already in the database.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Then,  B. In fact, C. Likewise, D. For example,  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. “Then” indicates that the events in this sentence took place after the events in the previous sentence. Only after users upload images of unknown soldiers can those images be analyzed.  

Choice B is incorrect. This transition is used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement. But this sentence doesn’t modify the step described in the previous statement: instead, it introduces an entirely new step in the process. So “in fact” wouldn’t make sense here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing the physical features in the uploaded photographs isn’t a similar idea, but rather the next step in the process. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing physical features is not an example of uploading and tagging an image.

Arkansas aviator Louise Thaden was already a record breaker when she won the inaugural National Women’s Air Derby, a race from California to Ohio, in August of 1929. ______ in December of 1928, Thaden had set an aviation record when she reached an altitude of 20,269 feet in a Travel Air biplane.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Earlier, B. However, C. Next, D. As a result,  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time. Since the first sentence talks about Thaden’s race win in 1929 and the second shifts back to talking about her record in 1928, this makes the most sense here.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with and expands on the previous sentence by describing the earlier record that Thaden had "already" held. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift forward in time, which doesn’t make sense here. A record in 1928 didn’t come after Thaden’s race win in 1929. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—an event in 1929 can’t cause something in 1928.  


# ID: 2b5e0731  

With darkness falling, a mother elephant loses sight of her calf and wants to make sure it is safe. ______ she releases an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Infrasonic sound is below the range of human hearing, but many animals can hear these sounds from several miles away.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. For example, B. For this reason, C. Nowadays, D. Similarly,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" is a cause-and-effect transition. The cause in this case is that the mother elephant wants to know that her calf is safe, so the effect is that she lets out an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Therefore, "for this reason" fits perfectly in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn’t provide an example of the events described in the first sentence. Instead, it describes what happens next: the mother elephant calls for her calf. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift from the past to the current time, which doesn’t make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they’re describing the same time period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates common ali ty or agreement between two ideas. But this sentence isn’t similar to the events in the first sentence. Instead, it describes the events that happen next.

The number of dark spots that appear on the Sun, known as sunspots, can vary greatly. For example, there were about 180 sunspots in November 2001. ______ there were only about 2 sunspots in December 2008.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A.  In other words, B. Similarly, C. Therefore, D. By comparison,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence claims that the number of sunspots can vary greatly. To support this claim, the next two sentences compare two examples: one time when there were 180 sunspots and one time when there were only 2 sunspots. So the transition “by comparison” fits perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence doesn’t restate the first example—it describes a totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence describes a second example that is very different from the first example. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The first example didn’t result in the second example.

$^{\prime\prime}{\sf O}2$   Arena,” an award-winning science fiction story by Nigerian author Og he necho v we Donald Ekpeki, takes place in an alternate version of Nigeria where breathable air is a rare commodity that is owned and sold by companies. ______ people must purchase it with currency called O2 credits.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. As a result, B. In any case, C. Nevertheless, D. Earlier,  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The second sentence describes a consequence of the system laid out in the first sentence: because air is owned and sold by companies in this world, people have to buy it.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “no matter what happens” or “whatever the situation is,” which doesn’t make sense here. There’s only one situation described in the text: a fictional world in which companies own all the breathable air, forcing people to buy it. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the same fictional situation. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time, which doesn’t make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they’re describing the same fictional time period.

As biologist Terrie Williams has documented, deep dives present a challenge for seals and other marine mammals. A seal must exert enough energy to propel itself hundreds of meters downward, while keeping its heart rate low enough that it doesn’t run out of oxygen while underwater. ______ a seal moves its flippers as little as possible on a deep dive, gliding to conserve energy.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In the first place, B. On the other hand, C. For this reason, D. In comparison,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “For this reason” logically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is a consequence of the information about seals in the previous sentence. That is, a seal moves its flippers as little as possible during a deep dive because it needs to keep its heart rate low enough that it does not run out of oxygen.  

Choice A is incorrect because “in the first place” illogically signals that this sentence is the first point in a discussion. Instead, the sentence describes a behavior that is a consequence of the previous information about seals.  Choice B is incorrect because “on the other hand” illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information. Choice D is incorrect because “in comparison” illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is being compared to the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information.

To explore how blinking affects social interactions, Dutch researchers observed interactions between human speakers and “listeners” (animated human faces on a screen). The researchers found that when the listeners blinked slowly, the speakers tended to talk for less time. ______ quicker blinks were associated with longer talking times.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. For example, B. Specifically, C. Firstly, D. By contrast,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. “By contrast” logically signals that the finding described in this sentence contrasts with the finding described in the previous sentence. That is, quicker blinks were associated with longer talking times, whereas slower blinks were associated with shorter talking times.  

Choice A is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the finding described in this sentence is an example of the finding described in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with that finding. Choice B is incorrect because “specifically” illogically signals that this sentence provides specific, precise details about the finding described in the previous sentence. Instead, it presents information that contrasts with that finding. Choice C is incorrect because “firstly” illogically signals that the finding described in this sentence is a first point or occurs first in a chronological sequence of events. Instead, it contrasts with the finding described in the previous sentence.

In 1891, dancer and choreographer Loie Fuller first performed her celebrated Serpentine Dance, artfully twirling her long, flowing skirt to create striking visual effects. ______ in 1896, cinema pioneers Auguste and Louis Lumière made a groundbreaking short film of Fuller’s dance.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. However, B. In conclusion, C. Later, D. In other words,  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “Later” logically signals that the event discussed in this sentence—the creation of the short film featuring Fuller’s dance—is a related event that occurred after the event discussed in the previous sentence (the 1891 debut of the dance).  

Choice A is incorrect because “however” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. Choice B is incorrect because “in conclusion” illogically signals that the information in this sentence concludes or summarizes the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect because “in other words” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence.

Riley Black—the author of critically acclaimed books such as My Beloved Brontosaurus (2013)—is best known for writing about dinosaurs, but she has also conducted hands-on fieldwork. ______ her fieldwork has included paleontological digs in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming, and her dinosaur fossil discoveries can be seen at places such as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Regardless,  B. Subsequently, C. Specifically,  D. Conversely,  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The second sentence provides more specific information about the fieldwork mentioned in the first sentence—that the paleontological digs took place in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Therefore, “specifically” fits perfectly in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. Rather, this sentence agrees with and elaborates on the last sentence by providing more specifics about the fieldwork Black does. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates that an event took place after another event. But the two sentences are not describing different events—instead, this sentence gives more details about the fieldwork discussed in the first sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. Rather, this sentence agrees with and elaborates on the last sentence by providing more specifics about the fieldwork Black does.

Laetitia Ky’s hair is her art. Inspired by hairstyles from various African tribes, the Ivorian artist uses wire and thread to sculpt her hair into all kinds of shapes. ______ she once made her hair into the shape of the continent of Africa—including the island of Madagascar!  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Soon, B. Elsewhere, C. For example, D. However,  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “For example” logically signals that the following information about Ky—that she once shaped her hair to look like Africa—is an example supporting the previous statement that she makes different shapes with her hair.  

Choice A is incorrect because “soon” illogically signals that the event described in this sentence occurred soon after the statement about Ky making different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes. Choice B is incorrect because “elsewhere” illogically signals that the event described in this sentence occurred in a different place than the statement about Ky making different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes. Choice D is incorrect because “however” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the statement that Ky makes different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes.

Most of the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system orbit G-type stars, like our Sun. In 2014, ______ researchers identified a planet orbiting KELT $.9_{i}$  , a B-type star more than twice as massive and nearly twice as hot as the Sun. Called KELT-9b, it is one of the hottest planets ever discovered.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. likewise, B. however, C. therefore, D. for example,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The word “however” logically signals that the information in this sentence about the planet KELT-9b—that it orbits a B-type star—contrasts with the previous information about planets discovered outside our solar system. Most of these planets orbit G-type stars, not B-type stars.  

Choice A is incorrect because “likewise” illogically signals that the information about the planet KELT-9b is similar to the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that information. Choice C is incorrect because “therefore” illogically signals that the information about the planet KELT-9b is a result of the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that  

information. Choice D is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the information about the planet KELT-9b is an example of the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that information.

In 1873, Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal observed that brain fibers have distinct boundaries with clear end points, a finding that went against earlier assumptions about the brain. ______ scientists had assumed that the brain was a continuous web of fused fibers, not a vast network of distinct, individual cells.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. However, B. Previously, C. As a result, D. Likewise,  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “Previously” logically signals that the fused fiber theory came before Ramón y Cajal’s discovery.  

Choice A is incorrect. “However” illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. While this theory does contrast with Ramón y Cajal’s discovery, the previous sentence concludes by stating that his discovery went against prior assumptions about the brain. The fact that the fused fiber theory was one of those earlier assumptions makes “however” an illogical choice. Choice C is incorrect because “as a result” illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was a result of the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory came before Ramón y Cajal’s discovery. Choice D is incorrect because “likewise” illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was similar to the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory, which came before Ramón y Cajal’s discovery, was very different from it.

For years, biologists have experimented with using grime-eating bacteria rather than harsh chemicals to clean artworks, and results have been impressive overall. ______ these bacterial strains—which can metabolize centuries’ worth of oil, glue, dirt, and other surface impurities without creating harmful byproducts—have proven more effective than traditional chemical cleaning methods.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. However, B. In many cases, C. As a result, D. Additionally,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence makes the claim that using grime-eating bacteria has led to “impressive results.” This sentence supports that claim by describing the specific findings of the biologists’ experimentation. The transition “in many cases” fits the context perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both claim that grime-eating bacteria are better at cleaning artworks than chemicals. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in context. The fact that the results of the experimentation have been impressive overall doesn’t cause the bacteria to have proven more effective. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But this sentence doesn’t introduce a new idea. Instead, it elaborates on the same idea laid out in the previous sentence by describing the “impressive results” in more detail.

Alexander Lawrence Posey (1873–1908) varied his focus and tone depending on the genre in which he was writing. In his poetry, he used heartfelt language to evoke the beauty and peacefulness of his natural surroundings; in his journalism, ______ he employed humor and satire to comment on political issues affecting his Muskogee Creek community.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. that is, B. granted, C. similarly, D. by contrast,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This sentence compares two examples of Posey’s tone: the “heartfelt language” he used in his poetry versus the “humor and satire” he used in his journalism. We know from these descriptions and from the claim in the previous sentence that the two tones are very different from each other. So the transition “by contrast” fits the context perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn’t restating the first example here. Instead, it’s offering a second, totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “admittedly.” But the text isn’t admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But these two examples are intentionally very different from each other, so “similarly” doesn’t make sense here.

Okot p’Bitek’s poem Song of Lawino (1966) explores postcolonial Ugandan life through the eyes of a woman living in a rural village. With its vibrant imagery, bitingly satiric tone, and dexterous use of traditional Acholi song and phraseology, the poem inspired a generation of East African writers. ______ those who adopted its style are often referred to as Okot School poets.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Nevertheless, B. Fittingly, C. By comparison,  D. Instead,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “Fittingly” is a transition that means “appropriately” or “suitably,” and it is appropriate that writers who adopted their style from Okot p’Bitek would be known as the Okot School poets.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence is not disagreeing with anything—rather, it’s discussing how it makes sense for those writers who adopted Okot’s style to be known as the Okot School poets. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that compares two ideas. But this sentence is not comparing the Okot School poets and their style to Okot’s style. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence is not disagreeing with anything—rather, it’s discussing how it makes sense for those writers who adopted Okot’s style to be known as the Okot School poets.

Because an achiral molecule is symmetrical, flipping it yields a structurally identical molecule. A flipped chiral molecule, ______ can be compared to a glove that has been turned inside out: it produces a structurally inverted molecule rather than an identical one.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. in other words, B. by contrast, C. for example, D. similarly,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This sentence compares a chiral molecule to an achiral one. It discusses how when a chiral molecule is flipped, it results in something very different than when an achiral molecule is flipped. So the transition "by contrast" fits the context perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in different words. But this sentence doesn’t restate the same idea as the previous sentence. Instead, it makes a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral instead of achiral). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence isn’t an example of the first sentence’s claim about achiral molecules: it actually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence—namely, that a chiral molecule acts very differently from an achiral molecule when flipped.

Jhumpa Lahiri’s story collection Interpreter of Maladies features multiple stories about romantic relationships. In “This Blessed House,” newlyweds argue over whether to replace items left by the previous owners of their new home. ______ in   $"\mathsf{A}$   Temporary Matter,” a husband and wife attempt to rekindle their relationship during a four-night blackout.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Granted, B. For example, C. Likewise, D. Hence,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. "Likewise" is a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea. In this sentence, the author is providing another similar example to that discussed in the previous sentence. Therefore, "likewise" works best in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "admittedly." But the text isn’t admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The second story is not an example of the story in the previous sentence—it’s another, similar story. And while both stories exemplify the first sentence in the text, the transition we’re looking for isn’t actually connected to that sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The first story didn’t result in the events of the second story.

Establishing Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is no easy task. Each month, readings of a single second from atomic clocks around the world are taken and sent to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in France. ______ BIPM metro logi sts perform the meticulous work of assembling these minutely disparate readings into a globally shared time standard.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. There, B. In particular, C. For example, D. Conversely,  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. "There" indicates that the work of calculating Coordinated Universal Time takes place at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. Because "there" indicates a location, it fits the context perfectly.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the work involved in calculating Coordinated Universal Time.

The chemical tri methyl amine N-oxide not only gives fish their fishy smell but also protects them from crushing hydrostatic pressure in deep waters. Tri methyl amine N-oxide strengthens the bonds between water molecules in a fish’s body. ______ these water molecules maintain their linked structure at extreme depths, thus preventing pressurerelated damage.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Nevertheless, B. As a result, C. However, D. For instance,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “As a result” indicates that water molecules maintaining their linked structure at high pressures is caused by the strengthening of these water molecules by tri methyl amine N-oxide. So the transition “as a result” fits the context perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous one—rather, it’s describing an effect of the phenomenon described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous one; it actually expands on the previous sentence by describing an effect of the strengthened molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence doesn’t provide an example or instance of the idea in the previous sentence. Instead, it explores the effects of the previous idea in more depth.

“Wish cycling”—putting non recyclable items into recycling bins under the mistaken belief that those items can be recycled—ultimately does more harm than good. Non recyclable items, such as greasy pizza boxes, can contaminate recyclable materials, rendering entire batches unusable. ______ non recyclable products can damage recycling plants’ machinery.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Fittingly,  B. On the contrary, C. Moreover, D. Nevertheless,  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that “wish cycling” is harmful, the previous sentence gives us an example, and this sentence gives us another example. So “moreover”—a transition that indicates the addition of another supporting point—fits perfectly here.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “appropriately” or “suitably,” which doesn’t make sense in context. This sentence adds another example of how “wish cycling” is harmful, so we’re looking for an addition transition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how “wish cycling” is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how “wish cycling” is harmful.

To discover which fruit varieties were grown in Italy’s Umbria region before the introduction of industrial farming, botanist Isabella Dalla Ragione often turns to centuries-old lists of cooking ingredients. ______ she analyzes Renaissance paintings of Umbria, as they can provide accurate representations of fruits that were grown there long ago.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In sum, B. Instead, C. Thus, D. Additionally,  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. “Additionally” logically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is an additional part of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. That is, to research which fruits Umbrians grew in the past, the botanist analyzes old paintings in addition to looking at old lists of ingredients.  

Choice A is incorrect because “in sum” illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is a concluding summary of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research. Choice B is incorrect because “instead” illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is an alternative to the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Rather, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research. Choice C is incorrect because “thus” illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is a result of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research.

In a heated debate in biogeography, the field is divided between dispersal is ts and v icarian cist s. ______ there are those who argue that dispersal is the most crucial determining factor in a species’ distribution, and those who insist that vicariance (separation due to geographic barriers) is. Bio geographer Isabel Sanmartín counts herself among neither.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Furthermore, B. By contrast, C. Similarly, D. That is,  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. “That is” logically signals that this sentence clarifies the terms of the scientific debate introduced in the previous sentence by explaining the difference between dispersal is ts and v icarian cist s.  

Choice A is incorrect because “furthermore” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely additional to (and separate from) the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersal is ts and v icarian cist s clarifies the terms of that debate. Choice B is incorrect because “by contrast” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersal is ts and v icarian cist s clarifies the terms of that debate. Choice C is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely similar to the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersal is ts and v icarian cist s clarifies the terms of that debate.

In 1815, while in exile in Jamaica, Venezuelan revolutionary Simón Bolívar penned a letter praising England’s republican government and expressing hope that Latin American nations seeking independence from Spain might achieve something similar. The letter was addressed to a local merchant, Henry Cullen; ______ though, Bolívar’s goal was to persuade political leaders from England and Europe to support his cause.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. additionally, B. ultimately, C. accordingly, D. consequently,  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “Ultimately” means “in the long run” or “at the highest level.” Although Bolívar wrote to a local merchant, his ultimate goal was to send a message to political leaders in Europe. Therefore, “ultimately” fits perfectly in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. However, the second part of the sentence actually disagrees with the first part. Bolívar addressed the letter to Cullen, but he was really sending a message to someone else. Notice how the contrast word “though” also acts as a transition between these ideas. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolívar’s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolívar’s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him.

In 2009, the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles hosted a special exhibition, Sueños/Yume, showcasing the works of local sculptor Dora de Larios. As suggested by the show’s title (sueños and yume mean “dreams” in Spanish and Japanese, respectively), de Larios’s art reflects a mix of cultural influences. ______ her work is grounded in the artistic traditions of both Mexico and Japan.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In addition, B. In contrast, C. Specifically, D. Therefore,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “Specifically” logically signals that this sentence provides specific, precise details elaborating on the previous sentence’s claim that de Larios’s art reflects a mix of cultures. This sentence specifies which cultures the previous sentence is referring to: the artistic traditions of both Mexico and Japan.  

Choice A is incorrect because “in addition” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a separate point that follows the previous claim about de Larios’s art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim. Choice B is incorrect because “in contrast” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the previous claim about de Larios’s art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim. Choice D is incorrect because “therefore” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result of the previous claim about de Larios’s art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim.

When one looks at the dark craggy vistas in Hitoshi Fugo’s evocative photo series, one’s mind might wander off to the cratered surfaces of faraway planets. ______ it’s the series’ title, Flying Frying Pan, that brings one back to Earth, reminding the viewer that each photo is actually a close-up view of a familiar household object: a frying pan.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Consequently, B. Alternatively, C. Ultimately, D. Additionally,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when they’re looking at the photos: they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has afterward: the title reminds them that the photos are of frying pans, bringing them back to reality. “Ultimately” is a transition that means “eventually” or “in the end,” so it fits the context perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The viewer imagining other planets when they’re looking at the photos doesn’t cause the title to bring them back to reality. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates another option or possibility, which doesn’t make sense here. Rather, the viewer has both experiences: first the viewer imagines that they’re looking at another planet, and then the title reminds them that it’s just a frying pan. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But the viewer’s experience in the second sentence is actually the opposite of the viewer’s experience in the first sentence. In the first sentence, the viewer is imagining that they’re seeing a landscape from another planet. In the second sentence, the viewer is reminded that they’re looking at a frying pan.

Plato believed material objects to be crude representations of unseen ideal forms. In his view, such abstract, non material forms are the ultimate source of knowledge. Aristotle disagreed, positing that knowledge is best obtained through direct engagement with the material world; ______ sensory experience of the material is the ultimate source of knowledge.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. regardless, B. admittedly, C. in other words, D. meanwhile,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “In other words” logically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows— that sensory experience is the source of knowledge—is a restatement of Aristotle’s theory from earlier in the sentence.  

Choice A is incorrect because “regardless” illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is true in spite of Aristotle’s theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory. Choice B is incorrect because “admittedly” illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is an exception to Aristotle’s theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory. Choice D is incorrect because “meanwhile” illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is separate from (while occurring simultaneously with) Aristotle’s theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory.

Magnetic levitation (maglev) trains are suspended above a track by powerful electromagnets, reducing friction and thus allowing for much faster speeds. Though maglev advocates in the US have long imagined these trains crisscrossing the country, their dream remains unrealized. ______ of the handful of maglev trains currently in operation, all are in Asia.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In fact, B. To that end, C. Nevertheless, D. That said,  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This sentence emphasizes just how far maglev advocates’ dreams are from coming true. “In fact” is a transition used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement and therefore fits perfectly in this context.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Maglev advocates’ dream remaining unrealized would not cause there to be only a few maglev trains, all located in Asia. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn’t make sense here. In fact, this sentence agrees with the previous sentence—both talk about how maglev trains are far from becoming common in the US. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn’t make sense here. In fact, this sentence agrees with the previous sentence—both talk about how maglev trains are far from becoming common in the US.

Iraqi artist Nazik Al-Malaika, celebrated as the first Arabic poet to write in free verse, didn’t reject traditional forms entirely; her poem “Elegy for a Woman of No Importance” consists of two ten-line stanzas and a standard number of syllables. Even in this superficially traditional work, ______ Al-Malaika was breaking new ground by memorializing an anonymous woman rather than a famous man.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. therefore, B. in fact, C. moreover, D. though,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "Though" is a contrast word similar to "but."  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "Therefore" doesn’t show contrast; it shows cause and effect. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "In fact" is a phrase that usually emphasizes the truth of the previous statement. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "Moreover" doesn’t show contrast—it introduces additional information that continues or supports the previous idea.

A 2017 study of sign language learners tested the role of iconicity—the similarity of a sign to the thing it represents—in language acquisition. The study found that the greater the iconicity of a sign, the more likely it was to have been learned. ______ the correlation between acquisition and iconicity was lower than that between acquisition and another factor studied: sign frequency.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. In fact, B. In other words, C. Granted, D. As a result,  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. “Granted” logically signals that the following information—that iconicity is not as highly correlated with acquisition as sign frequency—is true in spite of the information about the correlation between iconicity and acquisition in the previous sentence.  

Choice A is incorrect because “in fact” illogically signals that the sentence that follows either emphasizes or refutes the information in the previous sentence regarding the correlation between iconicity and acquisition. Instead, the sentence that follows provides additional information that is true in spite of the preceding information; it neither emphasizes nor refutes that information. Choice B is incorrect because “in other words” illogically signals that the sentence that follows is a restatement of the information in the previous sentence; instead, the sentence that follows provides additional information that is true in spite of the preceding information. Choice D is incorrect because “as a result” illogically signals that the sentence that follows is a result of the information in the previous sentence regarding the correlation between iconicity and acquisition; instead, the sentence that follows is true in spite of the preceding information.

“Tulip mania”—the rapid rise and sudden fall of the price of tulip bulbs in seventeenth-century Amsterdam—is often cited as an example of the perils of rampant market speculation. However, recent research has demonstrated that the episode was neither as frenzied nor as disastrous as has been thought. The popular myth surrounding it, ______ should be regarded with some skepticism.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. for example, B. by contrast, C. nevertheless, D. therefore,  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is arguing that new evidence contradicting popular beliefs about “tulip mania” should cast doubt on those beliefs. “Therefore” is a cause-and-effect transition, which fits perfectly in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Skepticism about the popular beliefs is not an example of recent evidence contradicting those beliefs—rather, skepticism is an effect of that recent evidence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. Instead, it connects a cause from the previous sentence (new evidence that tulip mania was not as disastrous as thought) to an effect (that we should look with skepticism upon the myth about its disastrous ness). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. Instead, it connects a cause from the previous sentence (new evidence that tulip mania was not as disastrous as thought) to an effect (that we should look with skepticism upon the myth about its disastrous ness).

Seismologists Kaiqing Yuan and Barbara Romanowicz have proposed that the magma fueling Iceland’s more than 30 active volcano systems emerges from deep within Earth. The great depths involved—nearly 3,000 km—mark Iceland’s volcanoes as extreme outliers; ______ many of Earth’s volcanoes are fed by shallow pockets of magma found less than  $15~\mathsf{k m}$   below the surface.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. indeed, B. nevertheless, C. in addition, D. consequently,  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The second part of the sentence says that many volcanoes use shallow pockets of magma. This is an elaboration of the same underlying idea from the first part of the sentence, which says that the super deep magma of Icelandic volcanoes’ makes them outliers. “Indeed” is a transition used for elaborating on the same idea, so it fits the context perfectly.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But these two parts of the sentence agree with each other, so “nevertheless” doesn’t make sense. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But the second part of the sentence isn’t adding a new idea: it’s elaborating on the same idea expressed in the first part of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The fact that Iceland’s deep-magma volcanoes are outliers doesn’t cause many other volcanoes to get fed by shallow pockets of magma.

With its clichéd imagery of suburban lawns and power lines, John Ashbery’s 2004 poem “Ignorance of the Law Is No Excuse” may seem barren terrain for critical analysis. ______ cultural critic Lauren Berlant finds fertile ground in just its first two stanzas, devoting most of a book chapter to deciphering the “weight of the default space” Ashbery creates in this poem.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. Likewise, B. Nonetheless, C. In turn, D. That is,  

ID: ad729337 Answer  

Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. “Nonetheless” is a transition that indicates disagreement. The first sentence describes the unlikelihood of finding much for critical analysis in Ashbery’s poem (“barren terrain”), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact find much to analyze in Ashbery’s poem (“fertile ground”), so the transition “nonetheless” fits perfectly.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—a poem seemingly having little opportunity for critical analysis would not cause someone to write an extensive critical analysis (in fact, we might expect the opposite). Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn’t restating the first idea here. Instead, it’s offering a contradiction to the idea expressed in the first sentence.  


# ID: ecb31049  

The Sun and other stars are powered by nuclear fusion reactions, in which two atoms collide to form a single heavier atom, releasing energy. Scientists have long believed that fusion has the potential to meet humanity’s clean energy needs. ______ prior to December 2022, no fusion reaction in a laboratory setting had ever generated a net energy gain.  

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?  

A. For this reason, B. Moreover, C. Specifically, D. That said,  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. Scientists believe in fusion’s potential as an energy source, but have struggled to actually make it work—in other words, there is a contradiction between scientists’ beliefs and their reality. “That said” is a disagreement transition that works perfectly in this context.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Scientists not being able to generate extra energy from lab fusion reactions isn’t an effect of them believing in fusion’s potential. Choice B is incorrect. This transition indicates the addition of another supporting point. But this sentence is not adding a supporting point to the previous sentence—scientists not being able to successfully generate energy from fusion isn’t another point in favor of fusion meeting humanity’s clean energy needs. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces or elaborates on a particular example. But this sentence doesn’t give an example of scientists’ belief in fusion’s potential to meet humanity’s clean energy needs—in fact, it contrasts that optimistic belief with the reality of past failures to successfully employ fusion for energy production.
