The following text is from Srimati Svarna Kumari Devi’s 1894 novel The Fatal Garland (translated by A. Christina Albers in 1910). Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood.  

She crossed the woods she knew so well. The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms. They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?  A. It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river. B. It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods. C. It emphasizes Shakti’s sense of belonging in the landscape. D. It conveys Shakti’s appreciation for her long-term friendships.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.  

Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” figuratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her longstanding friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships.

Researchers have found a nearly 164,000-year-old molar from a member of the archaic human species known as Denisovans in a cave in Laos, suggesting that Denisovans lived in a wider range of environments than indicated by earlier evidence. Before the discovery, Denisovans were thought to have lived only at high altitudes in relatively cold climates in what are now Russia and China, but the discovery of the tooth in Laos suggests that they may have lived at low altitudes in relatively warm climates in Southeast Asia as well.  

Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole? A. It dismisses as untrue the research presented in the previous sentence. B. It defines a term used in the description that follows in the rest of the sentence. C. It emphasizes the main goal of the research introduced in the previous sentence. D. It provides context that clarifies the significance of the information that follows in the rest of the sentence.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes how a new discovery expands our understanding of Denisovans. The underlined portion describes what we used to believe about Denisovans, which helps the reader understand the significance of the discovery of the molar: it suggests that they lived in more places than we’d previously thought.  

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. Instead, it explains what we used to believe about Denisovans before the discovery—it doesn’t dismiss the new discovery as false. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. No term is defined here. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. The text never tells us what the “goal” of the research was, just what its discovery was.

Historians Tiya Miles and Roy E. Finkenbine have both documented the assistance Indigenous peoples gave to Black freedom seekers leaving the South before the US Civil War. Much of the historical evidence of this help comes from Indigenous oral traditions and from autobiographies written by the freedom seekers. One such narrative is Jermain Loguen’s autobiography, which tells about how Neshnabé (Potawatomi) villagers offered him food, lodging, and directions during his 1835 journey from Tennessee to Canada.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence?  

A. It provides an example of an autobiography that describes help given by an Indigenous people to a Black freedom seeker.  

B. It shows why Loguen decided to write in great detail about his experiences traveling from Tennessee to Canada in his autobiography.  

C. It argues that autobiographies are particularly important sources of information about geography in the United States before the Civil War.  

D. It suggests that most historians believe that Neshnabé villagers were more successful in assisting freedom seekers than other people were.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions "autobiographies written by the freedom seekers." This sentence identifies Loguen’s autobiography as a specific example.  

Choice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences. Choice C is incorrect. The previous sentence identifies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specific topic, but not for "information about geography." The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source of information about that specific topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers). Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses other specific people who helped freedom seekers, and therefore can’t make a comparison between the Neshnabé and anyone else.

Composer Florence Price won first place for her score Symphony in E Minor at the 1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards. The piece was performed the following year by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a significant recognition of its quality. Price continued to compose many musical pieces throughout her career, blending traditional Black spirituals with classical European Romantic musical traditions. In recent years, Price’s concertos and symphonies have been performed and recorded by several major orchestras, further preserving her work for others to enjoy.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To provide examples of Price’s importance as a composer B. To argue that more major orchestras should perform Price’s compositions C. To describe the musical styles that inspired many of Price’s symphonies D. To compare Price’s scores with those of classical European composers  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text provides an overview of Florence Price’s importance by describing her success at the 1932 Wanamaker Foundation Awards, her blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, and the recent performances and recordings of her concertos and symphonies by major orchestras.  

Choice B is incorrect. The text does mention that Price’s compositions have been performed and recorded by major orchestras, but it doesn’t argue that more orchestras should do so. Choice C is incorrect. The text does mention the blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, but only briefly, as part of a broader overview of Price’s career. Choice D is incorrect. The text mentions Price’s blending of Black spirituals with classical European Romantic musical traditions, but it doesn’t directly compare Price’s scores with those of classical European composers.

The following text is adapted from Louisa May Alcott’s 1869 novel An Old-Fashioned Girl. Polly, a teenager, is visiting her friend Fanny.  

Fanny’s friends did not interest Polly much; she was rather afraid of them [because] they seemed so much older and wiser than herself, even those younger in years. They talked about things of which she knew nothing and when Fanny tried to explain, she didn’t find them interesting; indeed, some of them rather shocked and puzzled her.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To portray Polly’s reaction to Fanny’s friends B. To identify the topics Polly talks about with Fanny’s friends C. To explain how Fanny met some of her friends D. To illustrate how Fanny’s friends feel about Polly  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show how Polly reacted to some of Fanny’s other friends. The text describes Polly as being frightened of Fanny’s friends because they seemed “much older and wiser” to her and elaborates that they “talked about things of which” Polly was unfamiliar, uninterested, and shocked. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe Polly’s impressions of Fanny’s other friends.  

Choice B is incorrect because the text does not provide any of the topics Polly discussed with Fanny’s friends, stating only that Polly found the topics unfamiliar, uninteresting, and shocking. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Fanny and her other friends first met. Choice D is incorrect because the focus of the text is on Polly’s feelings about Fanny’s other friends, not on the other friends’ feelings about Polly.

San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the cultural life of the city.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To compare the Balmy Alley murals to other murals in San Francisco B. To offer an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals C. To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay D. To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the everchanging murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.

The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1897 nonfiction work De Profundis.  

People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going. They can’t know. In one sense of the word it is of course necessary to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge. But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom. The final mystery is oneself. When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole? A. It reinforces the text’s skepticism about the possibility of truly achieving self-knowledge. B. It speculates that some readers will share the doubts expressed in the text about the value of self-knowledge. C. It cautions readers that the text’s directions for how to achieve self-knowledge are hard to follow. D. It concedes that the definition of self-knowledge advanced in the text is unpopular.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text repeatedly claims that true self-knowledge can’t possibly be achieved, and this rhetorical question emphasizes that point.  

Choice B is incorrect. The underlined question doesn’t do this. The text never expresses doubts about the value of self-knowledge—rather, the text expresses doubts about the possibility of achieving self-knowledge. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined question doesn’t do this. The text doesn’t provide directions for how to achieve selfknowledge—rather, it claims that true self-knowledge is impossible to achieve. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined question doesn’t do this. The text doesn’t ever define self-knowledge, and popularity isn’t mentioned in the text at all.

In most building demolitions, the building materials are destroyed and sent to landfills. City officials in Portland, Oregon, wanted to reduce this waste. The officials passed a law requiring demolition companies to deconstruct some buildings instead. Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landfill.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To explain an effort made by the city of Portland to reduce demolition waste and some results of that effort  

B. To show that popular support for measures that reduce demolition waste has increased since 2019  

C. To argue that building deconstruction is not as effective as other measures at reducing demolition waste  

D. To discuss laws aimed to reduce demolition waste in Portland and compare them to similar laws in other cities  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The author first describes a Portland law aimed at reducing demolition waste, and then goes on to explain that  $27\%$   of materials from building deconstructions were able to be reused and the rest were recycled.  

Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the popularity of the law. Choice C is incorrect. The text never compares building deconstruction to other measures designed to reduce demolition waste. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions laws in cities other than Portland, Oregon.

The following text is from Holly Goldberg Sloan’s 2017 novel Short.  

More than two years ago my parents bought a piano from some people who were moving to Utah. Mom and Dad gave it to my brothers and me for Christmas. I had to act really happy because it was such a big present, but I pretty much hated the thing from the second it was carried into the hallway upstairs, which is right next to my bedroom. The piano glared at me. It was like a songbird in a cage. It wanted to be set free.  

$\circledcirc2017$   by Holly Goldberg Sloan  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It explains why the narrator always wanted a piano close to her bedroom.  

B. It establishes how the narrator feels about the piano.  

C. It suggests that the narrator’s brothers are talented piano players.  

D. It describes the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy a piano.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy.  

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah. Instead, the text focuses on the narrator’s feelings about the piano after it was given to her and her brothers.

Jackie Ormes’s Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem (1937–38) was the first comic strip by a Black woman to appear in a widely read newspaper. The strip tells the story of Torchy, a young woman who leaves Mississippi to become a performer in New York City. Torchy’s story reflects the experience of the Great Migration (1910–1970), when millions of Black Americans left the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United States. Torchy Brown thus shows how Ormes used comics to comment humorously on issues affecting Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To show how Ormes’s Torchy Brown inspired other Black women to write comic strips in the 1930s  

B. To illustrate how the subjects Ormes addressed in her comic strips changed over the course of her career  

C. To give an example of how Ormes presented the experiences of Black Americans in her comic strips  

D. To claim that several characters in Torchy Brown were based on people that Ormes knew personally  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The text describes how Torchy Brown depicted the experiences of a young Black woman experiencing America’s Great Migration. It further states that Ormes continued to use comics throughout her career to humorously comment on important issues impacting Black Americans.  

Choice A is incorrect. The text never mentions other Black women comic strip writers. Choice B is incorrect. The text never mentions any changes in the subjects Ormes addressed. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions the inspiration for characters in Torchy Brown.

Streams and rivers carry soil and rocks from one location to another. But there is another way for these geological materials to move. Scientists call this process “aeolian transport.” In aeolian transport, winds move small particles of soil or rock over potentially great distances. Geologist Melisa Diaz and her team studied dust in Antarctica to find out if it was moved by aeolian transport. They discovered that the dust matched geological material in Australia. Aeolian transport had carried it from one continent to another, across thousands of miles of open ocean.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole? A. It presents Melisa Diaz’s remarks about difficulties that her team encountered. B. It introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows.  C. It emphasizes the surprising nature of the findings that are presented. D. It explains the difference between two kinds of geological material.  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows.  

Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the text. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them. Rather, the underlined portion introduces the scientific term “aeolian transport,” which is used in the discussion that follows.

Many films from the early 1900s have been lost. These losses include several films by the first wave of Black women filmmakers. We know about these lost movies only from small pieces of evidence. For example, an advertisement for Jennie Louise Touissant Welcome’s documentary Doing Their Bit still exists. There’s a reference in a magazine to Tressie Souders’s film A Woman’s Error. And Maria P. Williams’s The Flames of Wrath is mentioned in a letter and a newspaper article, and one image from the movie was discovered in the 1990s.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text? A. The text identifies a complex problem, then presents examples of unsuccessful attempts to solve that problem.  B. The text summarizes a debate among researchers, then gives reasons for supporting one side in that debate.  C. The text describes a general situation, then illustrates that situation with specific examples.  

D. The text discusses several notable individuals, then explains commonly overlooked differences between those individuals.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The first three sentences describe the general situation: these early films have been lost, and we only know about them from small pieces of evidence. The rest of the text offers specific examples of the small pieces of evidence.  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The fact that we only know about these lost early films from small pieces of evidence isn’t presented as a “complex problem”—that’s too extreme. And the examples presented are not “unsuccessful attempts” to solve it. If anything, the examples represent a success, because we discovered that these films existed in the first place. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. There’s no “debate” presented in the text, so there’s no “side” for the text to support. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text doesn’t discuss any “differences” between the filmmakers.

Hiroshi Senju is known worldwide for his paintings of waterfalls. These paintings are large and tend not to show the entire waterfall.  Instead, Senju focuses on just the point where the falling water reaches the pool below, keeping the top of the waterfall out of view. While Senju’s paintings are rooted in art movements originating in the United States, the artist uses traditional Japanese techniques and materials that make his work instantly recognizable.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text? A. It introduces an artist and then explains some common characteristics of well-known paintings by that artist. B. It explains a specific painting technique and then provides examples of artists who use the technique. C. It describes a famous painting and then compares it to a lesser-known painting from the same time period.  

D. It gives an opinion on an artist and then suggests multiple reasons why the artist’s work has been largely overlooked.  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The first sentence introduces Senju as a famous artist, while the next three sentences describe the defining features of his art, such as it only showing part of the waterfall and its origins in US art movements and Japanese techniques.  

Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide examples of any other artists who use Senju’s techniques. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t describe any single famous painting or make comparisons between paintings. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide an opinion on Senju (just facts), nor does it suggest that his art has been overlooked—in fact, it states that he is “known worldwide.”

In 1801, a Blackfoot chief named Ac Ko Mok Ki drew a finely detailed map of the Upper Missouri region. This work demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge, as the map features specific names of mountains and rivers, as well as the first-known sketch of the drainage network of the Missouri River. The map is especially notable because Ac Ko Mok Ki also included details about the numerous tribes that lived in the area.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole? A. It emphasizes Ac Ko Mok Ki’s desire to represent other tribes on the map. B. It explains how Ac Ko Mok Ki developed an interest in mapmaking. C. It identifies some reasons why the map is impressive. D. It details how the map was used for hunting and trading purposes.  


Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text presents information about a map drawn by Blackfoot chief Ac Ko Mok Ki in 1801. The underlined sentence states that the map "demonstrates a vast amount of topographic knowledge" and mentions that it features the "specific names of mountains and rivers" and includes the first-known sketch of the Missouri River’s drainage network. These are all characteristics that indicate that the map was executed with remarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identifies some reasons why the map is impressive.  

Choice A is incorrect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence indicates how Ac Ko Mok Ki became interested in mapmaking, only that his mapmaking skills are impressive. Choice D is incorrect because though the underlined sentence describes several features of the map, it does not specifically describe how the map was used.

In many agricultural environments, the banks of streams are kept forested to protect water quality, but it’s been unclear what effects these forests may have on stream biodiversity. To investigate the issue, biologist Xingli Giam and colleagues studied an Indonesian oil palm plantation, comparing the species richness of forested streams with that of non forested streams. Giam and colleagues found that species richness was significantly higher in forested streams, a finding the researchers attribute to the role leaf litter plays in sheltering fish from predators and providing food resources.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It discusses research intended to settle a debate about how agricultural yields can be increased without negative effects on water quality.  

B. It explains the differences between stream-protection strategies used in oil palm plantations and stream-protection strategies used in other kinds of agricultural environments.  

C. It describes findings that challenge a previously held view about how fish that inhabit streams in agricultural environments attempt to avoid predators.  

D. It presents a study that addresses an unresolved question about the presence of forests along streams in agricultural environments.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The author first describes an unresolved question: what effect do bank forests have on stream biodiversity? Then the author presents a study that answers the question: bank forests increase stream biodiversity.  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions agricultural yields. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions other kinds of agricultural environments. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose of the text. The text never mentions any previously held view about how fish in these streams try to avoid predators.

Genetic studies have led researchers to suggest that turtles are most closely related to the group that includes modern crocodiles. But studies of fossils have suggested instead that turtles are most closely related to other groups, such as the one that contains modern snakes. However, many of the fossil studies have relied on incomplete data sets. For a 2022 investigation, biologist Tiago R. Simões and colleagues examined more than 1,000 reptile fossils collected worldwide. From this large data set, they found clear agreement with the results of the genetic studies.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence? A. It offers an overview of the tools scientists use to examine fossils. B. It describes a limitation of some studies about the origin of turtles. C. It summarizes previous research on the evolution of crocodiles. D. It criticizes a widely held belief about genetic studies of reptiles.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The sentence mentions that some fossil studies have relied on incomplete data sets, suggesting that these studies are limited in what they can tell us about turtles’ origins.  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the incompleteness of the data sets studied, it doesn’t mention any tools or techniques used to examine fossils. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence doesn’t mention anything about the evolution of crocodiles. Choice D is incorrect. This sentence doesn’t directly mention or criticize any "widely held belief," and it focuses on a limitation of fossil studies of reptiles, not genetic studies.

Archeological excavation of Market Street Chinatown, a nineteenth-century Chinese American community in San Jose, California, provided the first evidence that Asian food products were imported to the United States in the 1800s: bones from a freshwater fish species native to Southeast Asia. Jinsha n zhuang—Hong Kong–based import/export firms—likely coordinated the fish’s transport from Chinese-operated fisheries in Vietnam and Malaysia to North American markets. This route reveals the (often overlooked) multinational dimensions of the trade networks linking Chinese diaspora communities.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?  

A. It explains why efforts to determine the country of origin of the items mentioned in the previous sentence remain inconclusive.  

B. It provides information that helps support a claim about a discovery’s significance that is presented in the following sentence.  

C. It traces the steps that were taken to locate and recover the objects that are described in the previous sentence.  

D. It outlines a hypothesis that additional evidence discussed in the following sentence casts some doubt on.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides information about import/export firms, showing how Chinese communities across the world were connected by trade routes.  

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence never suggests that the countries of origin of the fish are in question—in fact, it tells us exactly where they came from. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never describes the steps taken to discover the fish bones described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t outline a hypothesis but instead provides evidence. And the following sentence agrees with the underlined sentence, so we could eliminate this choice just for saying that the following sentence "casts some doubt on" the underlined one—partly wrong is all wrong.

Using NASA’s powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Mercedes López-Morales and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light traveling through the atmosphere of WASP-39b, an exoplanet, or planet outside our solar system. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light, and the wavelength measurements showed the presence of carbon dioxide   $\left(\mathsf{C O}_{2}\right)$   in WASP-39b’s atmosphere. This finding not only offers the first decisive evidence of   $\mathsf{C O}_{2}$   in the atmosphere of an exoplanet but also illustrates the potential for future scientific breakthroughs held by the JWST.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text? A. It discusses a method used by some researchers, then states why an alternative method is superior to it. B. It describes how researchers made a scientific discovery, then explains the importance of that discovery. C. It outlines the steps taken in a scientific study, then presents a hypothesis based on that study.  

D. It examines how a group of scientists reached a conclusion, then shows how other scientists have challenged that conclusion.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The text begins by describing how the researchers used the JWST to detect  $\mathsf{C O}_{\scriptscriptstyle2}$   in WASP-39b’s atmosphere. Then the text discusses the significance of this finding, both as the first evidence of  $\mathsf{C O}_{\circ}$   in an exoplanet’s atmosphere and as an illustration of the JWST’s potential for making new discoveries in general.  

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t compare two different methods, but rather focuses on one study that used the JWST. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t present a hypothesis, but rather reports on the findings of a study. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention any scientists challenging the conclusion reached by López-Morales and colleagues.

Yawn contagion occurs when one individual yawns in response to another’s yawn. Studies of this behavior in primates have focused on populations in captivity, but biologist Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues have shown that it can occur in wild primate populations as well. In their study, which focused on a wild population of gelada monkeys (The r opi the cus gelada) in Ethiopia, the researchers further reported that yawn contagion most commonly occurred in males and across different social groups instead of within a single social group.  

Which choice best describes the function of the first sentence in the text as a whole?  

A. It defines a phenomenon that is discussed in the text. B. It introduces a problem that is examined in the text. C. It makes a claim that is challenged in the text. D. It presents a hypothesis that is evaluated in the text.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the first sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the first sentence is to define the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text.  

Choice B is incorrect. Although the first sentence introduces the text’s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn’t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem. Choice C is incorrect because the first sentence doesn’t present a claim but instead explains what yawn contagion is. Moreover, the text doesn’t challenge anything; it’s an informative text that describes the findings of a research study about yawning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes a scientific study, and most scientific studies are guided by a hypothesis, the text doesn’t say what Palagi and her colleagues’ hypothesis was; the text discusses their findings instead.

The following text is from Joseph Conrad’s 1907 novel The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Mr. Verloc is navigating the London streets on his way to a meeting.  

Before reaching Knightsbridge, Mr. Verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms [horse-drawn carriages]. Under his hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy. And Mr. Verloc, steady like a rock—a soft kind of rock—marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?  

A. It qualifies an earlier description of Mr. Verloc. B. It emphasizes an internal struggle Mr. Verloc experiences.  C. It contrasts Mr. Verloc with his surroundings. D. It reveals a private opinion Mr. Verloc holds.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The underline phrase qualifies (meaning adds limits or conditions to) the description of Mr. Verloc as “steady like a rock,” adding that he is a “soft” rock.  

Choice B is incorrect. In fact, the passage never mentions Mr. Verloc experiencing any internal struggles. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined phrase doesn’t contrast Mr. Verloc with his surroundings, but is instead modifying the description of him as a rock. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined phrase doesn’t reveal a private opinion Mr. Verloc holds: instead, it further describes his character for the reader.

In 1973, poet Miguel Algarín started inviting other writers who, like him, were Nuyorican—a term for New Yorkers of Puerto Rican heritage—to gather in his apartment to present their work. The gatherings were so well attended that Algarín soon had to rent space in a cafe to accommodate them. Thus, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe was born. Moving to a permanent location in 1981, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe expanded its original scope beyond the written word, hosting art exhibitions and musical performances as well. Half a century since its inception, it continues to foster emerging Nuyorican talent.  

Which choice best describes the overall purpose of the text?  

A. To explain what motivated Algarín to found the Nuyorican Poets Cafe B. To situate the Nuyorican Poets Cafe within the cultural life of New York as a whole C. To discuss why the Nuyorican Poets Cafe expanded its scope to include art and music D. To provide an overview of the founding and mission of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text presents a brief history of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, from how it got started in the ’70s, to its expansion in the  ${}^{\prime}80s,$  , to its ongoing mission today.  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall purpose. The text never mentions Algarín’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall purpose. The text never discusses the cultural life of New York as a whole. Choice C is incorrect. This is too narrow. One sentence mentions that the Nuyorican Poets Cafe expanded its scope to include art and music, but this is only one point in the broader history of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which is the overall focus of the text.

The following text is adapted from Charles Dickens’s 1854 novel Hard Times. Coketown is a fictional town in England.  [Coketown] contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To emphasize the uniformity of both the town and the people who live there B. To explain the limited work opportunities available to the town’s residents C. To reveal how the predictability of the town makes it easy for people lose track of time D. To argue that the simplicity of life in the town makes it a pleasant place to live  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The author describes Coketown as having streets that are all very similar and residents who live similarly and do the same work. This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike.  

Choice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents  $"\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{o}$   the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one.

The following text is adapted from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s 1902 novel The Sport of the Gods. Joe and some of his family members have recently moved to New York City.  

[Joe] was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant. In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes, and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going. Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people’s houses.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It illustrates a character’s reaction to a new environment.  

B. It explains why a character has traveled to a city.  

C. It compares a character’s thoughts about an event at two different times of day.  

D. It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment.  

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city. Joe’s home is mentioned, but only to compare it unfavorably with the city.

The following text is from Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s 1910 poem “The Earth’s Entail.”  

No matter how we cultivate the land, Taming the forest and the prairie free; No matter how we irrigate the sand, Making the desert blossom at command,

  We must always leave the borders of the sea;

  The im measure able reaches

  Of the windy wave-wet beaches, The million-mile-long margin of the sea.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text? A. The speaker argues against interfering with nature and then gives evidence supporting this interference.  

B. The speaker presents an account of efforts to dominate nature and then cautions that such efforts are only temporary.  

C. The speaker provides examples of an admirable way of approaching nature and then challenges that approach.  D. The speaker describes attempts to control nature and then offers a reminder that not all nature is controllable.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This best describes the overall structure of the text. In the first half of the text, the speaker describes our attempts to control nature: cultivating, taming, and irrigating different kinds of land. In the second half, the speaker states that we can never tame the sea or the beach.  

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never argues that we should not interfere with nature. Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never describes our cultivation, taming, and irrigation of land as “temporary.” Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never describes our cultivation, taming, and irrigation of land as an “admirable” approach to nature.” Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches.

The following text is adapted from Etsu Inagaki Sugimoto’s 1925 memoir A Daughter of the Samurai. As a young woman, Sugimoto moved from feudal Japan to the United States.  

The standards of my own and my adopted country differed so widely in some ways, and my love for both lands was so sincere, that sometimes I had an odd feeling of standing upon a cloud in space, and gazing with measuring eyes upon two separate worlds. At first I was continually trying to explain, by Japanese standards, all the queer things that came every day before my surprised eyes; for no one seemed to know the origin or significance of even the most familiar customs, nor why they existed and were followed.  

Which choice best describes the main purpose of the text?  

A. To convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of differences between two cultures she embraces  

B. To establish the narrator’s hope of forming connections with new companions by sharing customs she learned as a child  

C. To reveal the narrator’s recognition that she is hesitant to ask questions about certain aspects of a culture she is newly encountering  

D. To emphasize the narrator’s wonder at discovering that the physical distance between two countries is greater than she had expected  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at first, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces.  

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she’s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although “no one seemed to know” strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that “no one seemed to know the origin” of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she  
sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ “widely” and likens them to “two separate worlds,” these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator’s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them.

In the Here and Now Storybook (1921), educator Lucy Sprague Mitchell advanced the then controversial idea that books for very young children should imitate how they use language, since toddlers, who cannot yet grasp narrative or abstract ideas, seek reassurance in verbal repetition and naming. The most enduring example of this idea is Margaret Wise Brown’s 1947 picture book Goodnight Moon, in which a young rabbit names the objects in his room as he drifts off to sleep. Scholars note that the book’s emphasis on repetition, rhythm, and nonsense rhyme speaks directly to Mitchell’s influence.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. The text outlines a debate between two authors of children’s literature and then traces how that debate shaped theories on early childhood education.  

B. The text summarizes an argument about how children’s literature should be evaluated and then discusses a contrasting view on that subject.  

C. The text lists the literary characteristics that are common to many classics of children’s literature and then indicates the narrative subjects that are most appropriate for young children.  

D. The text presents a philosophy about what material is most suitable for children’s literature and then describes a book influenced by that philosophy.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text starts by introducing Mitchell’s philosophy about using simple, repetitive language in books for young children. Then it describes a book influenced by that philosophy, Goodnight Moon.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although two authors are mentioned in the text, they both agree about the type of language that should be contained in books for young children. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the evaluation of children’s literature. It does provide one view of how children’s books should be written, but never introduces a competing view. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention “many classics of children’s literature.” Instead, it describes an educational theory and identifies one example of a famous children’s book that was influenced by that theory.

Works of moral philosophy, such as Plato’s Republic or Aristotle’s Nico mac he an Ethics, are partly concerned with how to live a morally good life. But philosopher Jonathan Barnes argues that works that present a method of living such a life without also supplying a motive are inherently useful only to those already wishing to be morally good—those with no desire for moral goodness will not choose to follow their rules. However, some works of moral philosophy attempt to describe what constitutes a morally good life while also proposing reasons for living one.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. It provides a characterization about a field of thought by noting two works in it and then details a way in which some works in that field are more comprehensive than others.  

B. It mentions two renowned works and then claims that despite their popularity it is impossible for these works to serve the purpose their authors intended.  

C. It summarizes the history of a field of thought by discussing two works and then proposes a topic of further research for specialists in that field.  

D. It describes two influential works and then explains why one is more widely read than the other.  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text starts by stating what moral philosophy is concerned with and naming two examples of works in the field. Then it describes a shortcoming of some works in that field (they say how but not why), and finally it states that other works try to avoid that shortcoming (by including both how and why to live a morally good life).  

Choice B is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don’t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life. Rather, the text claims that works of moral philosophy that don’t include both how and why to be moral are not useful to readers who don’t already want to be moral. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never discusses the history of moral philosophy at all, and it doesn’t propose any topic for further research. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never discusses which of the two works is more widely read.

Industrial activity is often assumed to be a threat to wildlife, but that isn’t always so. Consider the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus): as forest growth has reduced grasslands in northern Germany, many of these butterflies have left meadow habitats and are now thriving in active limestone quarries. In a survey of multiple active quarries and patches of maintained grassland, an ecologist found silver-studded blue butterflies in  $100\%$   of the quarries but only  $57\%$   of the grassland patches. Moreover, butterfly populations in the quarries were four times larger than those in the meadows.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole? A. It challenges a common assumption about the species under investigation in the research referred to in the text. B. It introduces discussion of a specific example that supports the general claim made in the previous sentence. C. It suggests that a certain species should be included in additional studies like the one mentioned later in the text. D. It provides a definition for an unfamiliar term that is central to the main argument in the text.  


Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue butterfly is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a specific example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although the first sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue butterfly the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only one study: the “survey.” Additional studies are not mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor any other portion of the text provides a definition for any of the terms used in the text’s argument.

The following text is from Herman Melville’s 1854 novel The Lightning-rod Man.  

The stranger still stood in the exact middle of the cottage, where he had first planted himself. His singularity impelled a closer scrutiny. A lean, gloomy figure. Hair dark and lank, mattedly streaked over his brow. His sunken pitfalls of eyes were ringed by indigo halos, and played with an innocuous sort of lightning: the gleam without the bolt. The whole man was dripping. He stood in a puddle on the bare oak floor: his strange walking-stick vertically resting at his side.  

Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence in the overall structure of the text? A. It elaborates on the previous sentence’s description of the character. B. It introduces the setting that is described in the sentences that follow. C. It establishes a contrast with the description in the previous sentence. D. It sets up the character description presented in the sentences that follow.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This best states the function of the underlined sentence. The sentence basically says:  $^ Ḋ " Ḍ \mathrm{He}$   stood out, so I looked more closely at him.” Then the rest of the text describes him in detail.  

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t state the function of the underlined sentence. The previous sentence basically says: “He was still standing in the middle of the cottage”—it doesn’t include any description of the character himself.  Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t state the function of the underlined sentence. The following sentences describe the character, not the setting. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t state the function of the underlined sentence. The underlined sentence basically says:  $^ Ḋ \mathrm{He} Ḍ$   stood out, so I looked more closely at him.” The previous sentence basically says: “He was still standing in the middle of the cottage.” There’s no contrast between these two sentences.

Horizontal gene transfer occurs when an organism of one species acquires genetic material from an organism of another species through non reproductive means. The genetic material can then be transferred “vertically” in the second species—that is, through reproductive inheritance. Scientist Atma Ivancevic and her team have hypothesized infection by invertebrate parasites as a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer between vertebrate species: while feeding, a parasite could acquire a gene from one host, then relocate to a host from a different vertebrate species and transfer the gene to it in turn.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole? A. It explains why parasites are less susceptible to horizontal gene transfer than their hosts are. B. It clarifies why some genes are more likely to be transferred horizontally than others are. C. It contrasts how horizontal gene transfer occurs among vertebrates with how it occurs among invertebrates.  D. It describes a means by which horizontal gene transfer might occur among vertebrates.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text defines horizontal gene transfer and then gives one possibility for how it happens in vertebrates (via infection by parasites). The underlined part describes how that mechanism could work.  

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this.  Parasites are only described as the mechanism that does the transferring, not the species that gives or receives the genes. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this.  The text never discusses which genes are more likely to be transferred. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this.  The text never discusses how horizontal gene transfer occurs among invertebrates.

Part of the Atacama Desert in Peru has surprisingly rich plant life despite receiving almost no rainfall. Moisture from winter fog sustains plants once they’re growing, but the soil’s tough crust makes it hard for seeds to germinate in the first place. Local birds that dig nests in the ground seem to be of help: they churn the soil, exposing buried seeds to moisture and nutrients. Indeed, in 2016 Cristina Rengifo Faiffer found that mounds of soil dug up by birds were far more fertile and supported more seedlings than soil in undisturbed areas.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole? A. It elaborates on the idea that the top layer of Atacama Desert soil forms a tough crust.  B. It describes the process by which seeds are deposited into Atacama Desert soil. C. It identifies the reason particular bird species dig nests in Atacama Desert soil. D. It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama Desert soil.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertile ness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil.  

Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins.  Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identifies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil.

Michelene Pes an tub bee, a historian and citizen of the Choctaw Nation, has identified a dilemma inherent to research on the status of women in her tribe during the 1600s and 1700s: the primary sources from that era, travel narratives and other accounts by male European colonizers, underestimate the degree of power conferred on Choctaw women by their traditional roles in political, civic, and ceremonial life. Pes an tub bee argues that the Choctaw oral tradition and findings from archaeological sites in the tribe’s homeland supplement the written record by providing crucial insights into those roles.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. It details the shortcomings of certain historical sources, then argues that research should avoid those sources altogether.  

B. It describes a problem that arises in research on a particular topic, then sketches a historian’s approach to addressing that problem.  

C. It lists the advantages of a particular research method, then acknowledges a historian’s criticism of that method.  

D. It characterizes a particular topic as especially challenging to research, then suggests a related topic for historians to pursue instead.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The text begins by stating a problem with research on the status of Choctaw women in the 1600s and 1700s: written primary sources underestimate the power they had in their traditional roles. Then it presents one historian’s solution: looking to oral tradition and archeological findings for more insight into these roles.  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never says that research should avoid written primary sources, just that research should also use oral tradition and archeological sites as sources. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never mentions the advantages of using written primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never says that the status of Choctaw women during the 1600s and 1700s is too challenging to research. And it doesn’t mention any other topics to research instead.

Many archaeologists assume that large-scale engineering projects in ancient societies required an elite class to plan and direct the necessary labor. However, recent discoveries, such as the excavation of an ancient canal near the Gulf Coast of Alabama, have complicated this picture. Using radiocarbon dating, a team of researchers concluded that the 1.39-kilometer-long canal was most likely constructed between 576 and 650 CE by an Indigenous society that was relatively free of social classes.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text? A. It describes a common view among archaeologists, then discusses a recent finding that challenges that view. B. It outlines a method used in some archaeological fieldwork, then explains why an alternative method is superior to it.  

C. It presents contradictory conclusions drawn by archaeologists, then evaluates a study that has apparently resolved that contradiction.  

D. It identifies a gap in scientific research, then presents a strategy used by some archaeologists to remedy that gap.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text starts by introducing a common view among archaeologists about the need for an elite class to direct large-scale engineering projects. Then, it discusses the discovery of a large canal most likely built by a society without an elite class, which challenges the first view.  

Choice B is incorrect. Although the text discusses carbon dating as an archaeological method, it doesn’t compare it to any other alternative methods. Choice C is incorrect. The study doesn’t resolve any contradictions—rather, it introduces a contradiction to the one view presented at the beginning of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text never identifies any gaps in scientific research.

The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.  

What choice best describes the main purpose of the text? A. It describes an experimental method of measuring the strength of physiological responses in humans. B. It illustrates processes by which certain insects can express how they are feeling.  

C. It summarizes a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains.  

D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals.  

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they’re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn’t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions.

Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets. Flewellen argues that this sartorial practice shows that these women balanced hegemonic ideals of femininity with the requirements of their physically demanding occupation.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. To describe an unexpected discovery that altered a researcher’s view of how rapidly fashions among Black female farm workers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas changed during the period  

B. To discuss research that investigated the ways in which Black female farm workers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas used fashion practices to resist traditional gender ideals  

C. To evaluate a scholarly work that offers explanations for the impact of urban fashion ideals on Black female farm workers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas  

D. To summarize the findings of a study that explored factors influencing a fashion practice among Black female farm workers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farm workers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were influenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork.  

Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farm workers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen’s findings as "unexpected." Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farm workers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t evaluate a scholarly work but rather simply describes it. Furthermore, the text is focused on "agricultural and domestic" fashion, not urban fashion as this choice suggests.

The following text is adapted from Herman Melville’s 1857 novel The Confidence-Man. Humphry Davy was a prominent British chemist and inventor.  

Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcomb ical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant’s disdain; but, chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.  

B. It presents an account of a misunderstanding.  

C. It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.  

D. It explains why one character dislikes another.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The text tells a story of a first impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking guest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the guest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor.  

Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the very end is the savant "thrown aback" by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davy—he’s not "embarrassed about his own behavior." Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. It doesn’t include the second half of the text, where the savant gets into a conversation with the man and then finds out that the man is Sir Humphry Davy.

Some studies have suggested that posture can influence cognition, but we should not overstate this phenomenon. A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan  $\mathsf{O}^{\prime}$  Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitive ly demanding than sitting; accordingly,  $\mathsf{O}^{\prime}$  Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But  $\mathsf{O}^{\prime}$  Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It argues that research findings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study.  

B. It presents the study by  $\mathsf{O}^{\prime}$  Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition.  

C. It explains a significant problem in the emerging understanding of posture’s effects on cognition and how O’Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem.  

D. It discusses the study by O’Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on cognition.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a "case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitive ly demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition.  
Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O’Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.

In Jane Austen’s novel Mansfield Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware of it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry’s mental state through his gestures, but also infers that he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls “deep inter subjectivity,” a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which Austen’s novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?  

A. It states a claim about Austen’s skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by an example presented in the following sentence.  

B. It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from other Austen novels cited in the following sentence.  

C. It describes a recurring theme in Austen’s novels that is the focus of a literary scholar’s analysis summarized in the following sentence.  

D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in the following sentence.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers’ understanding of the “deep inter subjectivity” described in the next sentence as central to Austen’s work.  

Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen’s skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in the following sentence. This choice essentially flips the paragraph: it’s this first sentence that provides an example. Choice B is incorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn’t be the answer. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t identify any “recurring theme,” but instead simply describes one interaction from one book. This interaction exemplifies the literary technique of “deep inter subjectivity” that is introduced in the next sentence.

Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational figure in information theory. His most important paper,   $"\mathsf{A}$   Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon’s colleagues, said that the bit was “[Shannon’s] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung.”  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. It presents a theoretical concept, illustrates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has entered common usage.  

B. It introduces a respected researcher, describes an aspect of his work, and suggests why the work is historically significant.  

C. It names the company where an important mathematician worked, details the mathematician’s career at the company, and provides an example of the recognition he received there.  

D. It mentions a paper, offers a summary of the paper’s findings, and presents a researcher’s commentary on the paper.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The text starts with a general statement that introduces Shannon, then describes a specific contribution from one of his papers, then provides a quote that illustrates just how important this contribution was.  

Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text only mentions very briefly, in parentheses, that

 “binary digit” was shortened to “bit.” It doesn’t go into detail about this name change, and it doesn’t discuss any

 “common usage” of the name at all. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. Shannon’s employment at Bell Labs is only mentioned once, very briefly: the text never goes into detail about his career there, and it never mentions any recognition he received there. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. Overall, the text is about Shannon’s importance in his field, not just this one paper of his.

According to Indian economist and sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889–1968), the Euro centric concepts that informed early twentieth-century social scientific methods—for example, the idea that all social relations are reducible to struggles between individuals—had little relevance for India. Making the social sciences more responsive to Indians’ needs, Mukerjee argued, required constructing analytical categories informed by India’s cultural and ecological circumstances. Mukerjee thus proposed the communal is t “Indian village” as the ideal model on which to base Indian economic and social policy.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. The text recounts Mukerjee’s early training in the social scientific disciplines and then lists social policies whose implementation Mukerjee oversaw.  

B. The text mentions some of Mukerjee’s economic theories and then traces their impact on other Indian social scientists of the twentieth century.  

C. The text presents Mukerjee’s critique of the social sciences and then provides an example of his attempts to address issues he identified in his critique.  

D. The text explains an influential economic theory and then demonstrates how that theory was more important to Mukerjee’s work than other social scientists have acknowledged.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The text does indeed present Mukerjee’s critique of the social sciences—that they were too Euro centric—and then provides an example of how he attempted to address the issues he identified: by suggesting a social science model based on the Indian village.  

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss Mukerjee’s early training or his oversight of the implementation of social policies at all. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses any other Indian social scientists. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions other social scientists’ responses to Mukerjee’s work.

Space scientists Anna-Lisa Paul, Stephen M. Elardo, and Robert Ferl planted seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana in samples of lunar regolith—the surface material of the Moon—and, serving as a control group, in terrestrial soil. They found that while all the seeds germinated, the roots of the regolith-grown plants were stunted compared with those in the control group. Moreover, unlike the plants in the control group, the regolith-grown plants exhibited red pigmentation, reduced leaf size, and inhibited growth rates—indicators of stress that were corroborated by post harvest molecular analysis.  

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?  

A. It describes an experiment that addressed an unresolved question about the extent to which lunar regolith resembles terrestrial soils.  

B. It compares two distinct methods of assessing indicators of stress in plants grown in a simulated lunar environment. C. It presents evidence in support of the hypothesis that seed germination in lunar habitats is an unattainable goal. D. It discusses the findings of a study that evaluated the effects of exposing a plant species to lunar soil conditions.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes an experiment wherein space scientists compared plant growth in terrestrial and lunar soil conditions. It then discusses the findings of the study, including the fact that all the seeds germinated but that the plants grown in lunar soil exhibited signs of stress.  

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t address this question, and never describes any specific characteristics of either soil. It merely describes the outcome of an experiment that exposed a plant species to lunar soil conditions. Choice B is incorrect. The text never compares methods of assessing indicators of stress—instead, it simply mentions several stress indicators observed in the study (red pigmentation, reduced leaf size, and inhibited growth rates). Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t present any evidence that we could never achieve seed germination in lunar habitats, and in fact states that the seeds in the lunar soil did germinate.

Raymond Antrobus, an accomplished poet and writer of prose, recently released his debut spoken word poetry album, The First Time I Wore Hearing Aids, in collaboration with producer Ian Brennan. The album contains both  

autobiographical and reflective pieces combining Antrobus’s spoken words with Brennan’s fragmented audio elements and pieces of music to convey how people who are deaf may experience sound, both its presence and absence. Some critics suggest that the album questions the function of sound in the world, highlighting that the experience of sound is multifaceted.  

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?  

A. It introduces a collaborative spoken word poetry project, details the approach taken to produce the work, and then provides an example of critique the album received upon release.  

B. It mentions a collection of spoken word poems, distinguishes one poem as being an exemplar on the album, and then offers a summary of the subject matter of the whole collection.  

C. It summarizes the efforts to produce a collection of spoken word poems, presents biographies of two people who worked on the album, and speculates about the meaning behind the poetry.  

D. It connects two artists to the same spoken word poetry project, explains the extent of their collaboration on each poem, and then provides an overview of the technique used to produce the work.  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text first introduces the album as being a collaboration between Antrobus and Brennan, then describes the approach taken to produce it, then mentions how critics have said that it calls into question the function of sound.  

Choice B is incorrect. While the text does mention a collection of spoken word poems, it doesn’t single out one poem as being particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the text doesn’t simply summarize the subject matter—it goes into detail about the content and production of the album. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide biographical information about the two artists, and the text doesn’t speculate about the meaning behind the poetry—instead, it relays what some critics have said about the album. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide just an overview of the production techniques used but instead goes into more detail about the content and audio elements of the album, as well as critical response to the album.

The 1967 release of Harold Cruse’s book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual isolated him from almost all other scholars and activists of the American Civil Rights Movement—though many of those thinkers disagreed with each other, he nonetheless found ways to disagree with them all. He thought that activists who believed that Black people such as himself should culturally assimilate were naïve. But he also sharply criticized Black nationalists such as Marcus Garvey who wanted to establish independent, self-contained Black economies and societies, even though Cruse himself identified as a Black nationalist.  

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole? A. It describes a direction that Cruse felt the Civil Rights Movement ought to take. B. It indicates that Cruse’s reputation as a persistent antagonist of other scholars is undeserved. C. It describes a controversy that Cruse’s work caused within the Black nationalist movement. D. It helps explain Cruse’s position with respect to the community of civil rights thinkers.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text as a whole claims that Cruse disagreed with virtually all other Civil Rights scholars and activists. The underlined sentence describes one way that Cruse both did and didn’t fit in with those thinkers: he criticized Black nationalists, even though he identified as one.  

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn’t do this. It describes Cruse’s criticisms—it never mentions what Cruse did want the movement to do instead. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with the text, which argues that Cruse did disagree with almost all other scholars of the Civil Rights Movement. Choice C is incorrect. This is a step too far. The text never says that Cruse’s work caused controversy within the Black nationalist movement.
