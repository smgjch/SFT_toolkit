While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Muckrakers were journalists who sought to expose corruption in US institutions during the Progressive Era (1897–1920). Ida Tarbell was a muckraker who investigated the Standard Oil Company. She interviewed Standard Oil Company executives, oil industry workers, and public officials. She examined thousands of pages of the company’s internal communications, including letters and financial records. Her book The History of the Standard Oil Company (1904) exposed the company’s unfair business practices.  

The student wants to emphasize the thoroughness of Ida Tarbell’s investigation of the Standard Oil Company. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Ida Tarbell not only interviewed Standard Oil executives, oil industry workers, and public officials but also examined thousands of pages of the company’s internal communications.  

B. Ida Tarbell, who investigated the Standard Oil Company, was a muckraker (a journalist who sought to expose corruption in US institutions during the Progressive Era, 1897–1920).  

C. As part of her investigation of the Standard Oil Company, muckraker Ida Tarbell conducted interviews.  

D. Published in 1904, muckraker Ida Tarbell’s book The History of the Standard Oil Company exposed the company’s unfair business practices.

John Carver was one of the 41 signatories of the Mayflower Compact. The Mayflower Compact was a legal agreement among the pilgrims that immigrated to Plymouth Colony. It was created in 1620 to establish a common government. It states that the pilgrims who signed it wanted to “plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia” under King James. Carver became the first governor of Plymouth Colony.  

The student wants to specify the reason the Mayflower Compact was created. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Stating that its signatories wanted to “plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia,” the Mayflower Compact was a legal agreement among the pilgrims that immigrated to Plymouth Colony.  

B. Created in 1620, the Mayflower Compact states that the pilgrims wanted to “plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia.”  

C. The Mayflower Compact was created to establish a common government among the pilgrims that immigrated to Plymouth Colony.  

D. The Mayflower Compact had 41 signatories, including John Carver, the first governor of Plymouth Colony.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The sentence specifies the reason the Mayflower Compact was created, noting that it was created to establish a common government among the pilgrims that immigrated to Plymouth Colony.  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence provides background information about the Mayflower Compact and notes the signatories’ goal for the colony, it doesn’t specify why the compact was created. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence provides background information about the Mayflower Compact and notes the signatories’ goal for the colony, it doesn’t specify why the compact was created. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence specifies the number of pilgrims that signed the Mayflower Compact; it doesn’t specify the reason the compact was created.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Some US reformers sought to improve society in the 1800s by building utopias. A utopia is a community intended to represent a perfect society based on a specific set of principles. One such community was Brook Farm near Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1841 by writer George Ripley. Ripley wrote in a letter that his goal for Brook Farm was “to guarantee the highest mental freedom, by providing all with labor, adapted to their tastes and talents, and securing to them the fruits of their industry.”  

The student wants to explain the goal of Brook Farm using a quotation from George Ripley. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. In a letter, writer George Ripley explained his goal to “guarantee the highest mental freedom.”  

B. Utopias, such as Brook Farm, founded by George Ripley in 1841, were based on a specific set of principles intended to create a perfect society.  

C. Founded by George Ripley near Boston, Massachusetts, Brook Farm was part of a trend in the 1800s, when reformers in the United States built utopias.  

D. Established in 1841, Brook Farm was a utopian community created to “guarantee the highest mental freedom, by providing all with labor... [and] the fruits of their industry,” according to founder George Ripley.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This choice explains the goal of Brook Farm—to provide mental freedom to all by engaging individuals in labor suited to their interests—using a quotation from George Ripley.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice only mentions part of Ripley’s goal, and it doesn’t mention Brook Farm at all. Choice B is incorrect. This choice defines what a utopia is but doesn’t use Ripley’s words to describe his vision for Brook Farm. Choice C is incorrect. This choice provides some background information about Brook Farm, but it doesn’t explain its goals or include Ripley’s words.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Mexican tetras are a fish species with two distinct populations. Surface-dwelling tetras live on the surface and are able to see. Cave-dwelling tetras live in total darkness and have lost the ability to see. Cave-dwelling tetras have asymmetrical skulls with more sensory receptors on one side than the other. These receptors help cave-dwelling tetras navigate in darkness.  

The student wants to emphasize a difference between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras may belong to the same species, but they are quite different. B. Cave-dwelling tetras can no longer see but use sensory receptors on their skulls to navigate. C. Mexican tetras are a fish species with two distinct populations: surface-dwelling tetras and cave-dwelling tetras. D. Surface-dwelling tetras can see, whereas cave-dwelling tetras cannot.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras, noting that while surface-dwelling tetras can see, cave-dwelling tetras can’t.  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras are different, it doesn’t emphasize any difference between the two populations of tetras. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence explains that cave-dwelling tetras use sensory receptors on their skulls to navigate; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence notes that there are two different populations of Mexican tetras, it doesn’t emphasize any difference between the two populations.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

From Earth, all the meteors in a meteor shower appear to originate from a single spot in the sky. This spot is called the meteor shower’s radiant. The Perseid meteor shower is visible in the northern hemisphere in July and August. Like many meteor showers, it is named for the location of its radiant. Its radiant is located within the constellation Perseus.  

The student wants to explain the origin of the Perseid meteor shower’s name. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. The Perseid meteor shower is named for the constellation Perseus, the location of the meteor shower’s radiant. B. A meteor shower’s name may be linked to a single spot in the sky. C. The Perseid meteor shower, which has a radiant, is visible in the northern hemisphere in July and August. D. From Earth, all the meteors in a meteor shower appear to originate from a radiant, such as the one within Perseus.  


Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The sentence explains the origin of the Perseid meteor shower’s name: the constellation Perseus, where the meteor shower’s radiant is located.  

Choice B is incorrect. The sentence makes a claim about meteor shower names in general; it doesn’t explain the origin of the Perseid meteor shower’s name specifically. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates when and where the Perseid meteor shower is visible; it doesn’t explain the origin of the meteor shower’s name. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence discusses meteor showers in general; it doesn’t explain the origin of the Perseid meteor shower’s name.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Claude McKay (1889–1948) was a Jamaican American writer. Songs of Jamaica (1912) and Constab Ballads (1912) are two acclaimed poetry collections that McKay published while living in Jamaica. McKay moved to Harlem in New York City in 1914. He is best known as a poet and novelist of the Harlem Renaissance, a literary and cultural movement of the 1920s and 1930s. His most famous works include the poetry collection Harlem Shadows (1922) and the novel Home to Harlem (1928).  

The student wants to emphasize Claude McKay’s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Jamaican American writer Claude McKay is the author of works such as Songs of Jamaica (1912), Constab Ballads (1912), Harlem Shadows (1922), and Home to Harlem (1928).  

B. Although he is best known as a Harlem Renaissance writer, Claude McKay had published two acclaimed poetry collections in 1912 while living in Jamaica: Songs of Jamaica and Constab Ballads.  

C. In 1914, Claude McKay moved to Harlem, where he would become known as a poet and novelist of the Harlem Renaissance (a literary and cultural movement of the 1920s and 1930s).  

D. Before moving to Harlem, Claude McKay—author of the poetry collection Harlem Shadows (1922) and the novel Home to Harlem (1928)—lived in Jamaica.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice contrasts McKay’s fame as a Harlem Renaissance writer with his earlier achievements as a Jamaican poet, and it names the two collections he published before moving to Harlem.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize McKay’s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It lists some of his works but doesn’t distinguish between those he wrote in Jamaica and those he wrote in Harlem. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize McKay’s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It only mentions the year he moved and what he would become known for afterwards. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize McKay’s accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It mentions that he lived in Jamaica, but it doesn’t name any of the works he published there.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Architect Julian Abele studied Gregorian and neo-Gothic architecture in Europe. Abele worked for an architecture firm that was hired in 1924 to design buildings for Duke University’s new campus. Most of the buildings on Duke’s campus were designed in the Gregorian or neo-Gothic architectural styles. At the time, Abele was not formally credited with designing the buildings. Based on the buildings’ architectural styles, historians believe Abele designed most of the campus buildings.  

The student wants to specify why historians believe Abele designed most of Duke’s campus buildings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Given that most of the buildings on Duke’s campus feature architectural styles that Abele had studied in Europe, historians believe Abele is the one who designed them.  

B. Though Abele wasn’t formally credited at the time, historians believe he designed most of the buildings on Duke’s campus.  

C. Most of Duke’s campus buildings, which were designed by a firm Abele worked for, were designed in the Gregorian and neo-Gothic architectural styles.  

D. Abele, an architect who studied Gregorian and neo-Gothic architecture in Europe, is believed to have designed most of the buildings on Duke’s campus.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The sentence specifies why historians believe Abele designed most of Duke’s campus buildings, noting that most of the buildings feature architectural styles that Abele had studied.  

Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence explains that historians believe Abele designed most of Duke’s campus buildings, it doesn’t specify why historians hold that belief. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes the architectural styles of Duke’s campus buildings; it doesn’t specify why historians believe Abele designed the buildings. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence explains that Abele is believed to have designed most of the buildings on Duke’s campus, it doesn’t specify why historians believe that he designed the buildings.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

In geology, an Aeolian landform is one that has been created by the wind. In Greek mythology, Aeolus is the keeper of the winds. Aeolian landforms are created when the wind erodes, transports, or deposits material. A mushroom rock is a rock formation in which the top is wider than the base. A mushroom rock can be formed when the wind erodes the base and the top at different rates.  

The student wants to provide an explanation and an example of Aeolian landforms. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Aeolian landforms are created by different wind-based processes; for example, some are created by wind erosion.  

B. Aeolian landforms—landforms created by the wind—include the mushroom rock, a rock formation in which the wind erodes the base of the rock faster than the top.  

C. Erosion, transportation, and deposition are three examples of how the wind can create Aeolian landforms and mushroom rocks.  

D. A mushroom rock is a rock formation that owes its shape to the wind, a natural force associated with Aeolus in Greek mythology.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The sentence provides an explanation and an example of Aeolian landforms, explaining that they are landforms created by wind and offering the mushroom rock as an example.  

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence explains that Aeolian landforms are created by wind but does not provide an example of any specific Aeolian landforms. Rather, the example it provides is of a wind-based process. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides a partial explanation of Aeolian landforms, noting that they are created by the wind, it does not effectively provide an example. The sentence seems to indicate that mushroom rocks, rather than being an example of Aeolian landforms, are distinct from them. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides an explanation of a mushroom rock, which is a specific example of an Aeolian landform, it doesn’t provide an explanation of Aeolian landforms in general.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

J.R.R. Tolkien’s 1937 novel The Hobbit features two maps. The novel opens with a reproduction of the map that the characters use on their quest. This map introduces readers to the fictional world they are about to enter. The novel closes with a map depicting every stop on the characters’ journey. That map allows readers to reconstruct the story they have just read.  

The student wants to contrast the purposes of the two maps in The Hobbit. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. The Hobbit’s opening map introduces readers to the fictional world they are about to enter, while the closing map allows them to reconstruct the story they have just read.  

B. The Hobbit, a novel published by J.R.R. Tolkien in 1937, features a reproduction of a map that the characters use on their quest, as well as a map that appears at the end of the novel.  

C. The Hobbit’s two maps, one opening and one closing the novel, each serve a purpose for readers. D. In 1937, author J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit, a novel featuring both an opening and a closing map.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The sentence contrasts the purposes of the two maps in The Hobbit, noting that the opening map introduces readers to the book’s fictional world, while the closing map helps readers reconstruct the story. The word “while” helps signal a contrast between the purposes of the maps.  

Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two maps, it doesn’t contrast the maps’ purposes. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two maps and notes that each has a purpose, it doesn’t specify what those purposes are or how they contrast. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two maps, it doesn’t contrast the maps’ purposes.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Etel Adnan was a Lebanese American poet and artist known for making many leporellos. A leporello is an artist’s book that is folded accordion style. When the book is expanded, the artist’s work is revealed, and its zigzag shape allows it to stand on its own. Her leporello December from My Window (1993) features a panoramic landscape. It is painted using ink and watercolor.  

The student wants to describe Adnan’s December from My Window to an audience already familiar with leporellos. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Featuring a panoramic landscape, the 1993 work is one of Adnan’s many leporellos, which are accordion-style folded books that when expanded reveal the artist’s work.  

B. When expanded, Adnan’s 1993 leporello December from My Window reveals a panoramic landscape painted in ink and watercolor.  

C. Known for making many other accordion-style folded books called leporellos, Adnan created December from My Window in 1993.  

D. A leporello, such as Adnan’s December from My Window, is folded accordion style, and due to its zigzag shape it is able to stand on its own when fully expanded.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice describes Adnan’s December from My Window in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with leporellos and focuses on the specific features of the work—its content and medium.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn’t need to have the term defined or explained. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t describe Adnan’s December from My Window. It mentions the year and the type of work but not the content or the medium. In addition, it provides a simple definition of leporellos, making this an inappropriate choice for an audience already familiar with leporellos. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn’t need to have the term defined.

The MexiCali Biennial has taken place on an uneven schedule, with exhibitions in 2006, 2009–10, 2013, and 2018–20.  

The student wants to emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. In 2006, artists Ed Gomez and Luis Hernandez founded the MexiCali Biennial, which has taken place in 2006, 2009– 10, 2013, and 2018–20.  

B. Unlike traditional biennials, the MexiCali Biennial hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule.  

C. The term biennial traditionally refers to an art exhibition that takes place every two years in a single location, not to exhibitions hosted at a variety of times and venues.  

D. Biennial exhibitions have been held in New York, Berlin, and Venice but also on both sides of the US-Mexico border.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The sentence effectively emphasizes a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials, stating that the MexiCali Biennial is unlike traditional biennials because it hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule.  

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates who founded the MexiCali Biennial and the years this biennial has taken place; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence clarifies the traditional meaning of biennial with language that could apply to the MexiCali Biennial, it doesn’t mention the MexiCali Biennial by name. Therefore, the sentence doesn’t effectively emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence notes locations where various biennial exhibitions have been held; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials.

Just like states have state flags, some cities have city flags. Over one hundred US cities have redesigned their flags since 2015. The city of Pocatello, Idaho, redesigned its flag after it was named the most poorly designed flag in North America. Pocatello’s new flag better represents the city’s mountainous geography and civic priorities. Residents consider the new flag to be a meaningful symbol of civic pride.  

The student wants to make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Over one hundred US cities have redesigned their flags, including Pocatello, whose flag had been named the most poorly designed flag in North America.  

B. Pocatello is just one of over one hundred US cities that have redesigned their flags.  

C. After it was named the most poorly designed flag in North America, the flag of Pocatello was redesigned to better represent the city’s geography and civic priorities.  

D. Redesigning a poorly designed city flag can create a meaningful symbol of civic pride, as was the case when Pocatello redesigned its original flag to better represent its geography and civic priorities.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes and supports a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag, noting that redesigning a city flag can create a meaningful symbol of civic pride, as was the case when the city of Pocatello redesigned its flag.  

Choice A is incorrect because the sentence explains that many US cities have redesigned their flags and provides an example; it doesn’t make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence provides an example of a city that redesigned its flag; it doesn’t make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes why the flag of Pocatello was redesigned; it doesn’t make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Minnesota defines a lake as an inland body of water of at least 10 acres. Wisconsin’s definition of a lake doesn’t take size into account. By its own definition, Wisconsin has over 15,000 lakes, many smaller than 10 acres. By Minnesota’s definition, Wisconsin has only about 6,000 lakes.  

The student wants to contrast Minnesota’s definition of a lake with Wisconsin’s. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Wisconsin, which doesn’t take size into account in defining a lake, claims that it has over 15,000 lakes. B. Because its definition of a lake is different from Minnesota’s, it is unclear how many lakes Wisconsin really has.  

C. According to Minnesota’s definition of a lake—an inland body of water of at least 10 acres—Wisconsin has about 6,000 lakes.  

D. Minnesota’s definition of a lake—an inland body of water of at least 10 acres—is more restrictive than Wisconsin’s, which doesn’t take size into account.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts Minnesota’s definition of a lake with Wisconsin’s, explaining that Minnesota’s definition (which takes size into account) is more restrictive than Wisconsin’s definition (which doesn’t).  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that Wisconsin’s definition of a lake doesn’t take size into account, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s definition with Wisconsin’s. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that Wisconsin’s definition of a lake is different from Minnesota’s, but it doesn’t clarify how they differ. In other words, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s definition with Wisconsin’s. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates how many lakes Wisconsin has according to Minnesota’s definition of a lake, but it doesn’t clarify how the states’ definitions differ. In other words, it doesn’t contrast Minnesota’s definition with Wisconsin’s.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Maika’i Tubbs is a Native Hawaiian sculptor and installation artist. His work has been shown in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Germany, among other places. Many of his sculptures feature discarded objects. His work Erasure (2008) includes discarded audio cassette tapes and magnets. His work Home Grown (2009) includes discarded pushpins, plastic plates and forks, and wood.  

The student wants to emphasize a similarity between the two works. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Erasure (2008) uses discarded objects such as audio cassette tapes and magnets; Home Grown (2009), however, includes pushpins, plastic plates and forks, and wood.  

B. Tubbs’s work, which often features discarded objects, has been shown both within the United States and abroad.  

C. Like many of Tubbs’s sculptures, both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects: Erasure uses audio cassette tapes, and Home Grown uses plastic forks.  

D. Tubbs completed Erasure in 2008 and Home Grown in 2009.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice most effectively emphasizes "a similarity" by identifying a trait the works share: "both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects."  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity." Instead, this choice shows how the materials used in the two works are different. Notice the use of the contrast word "however." Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity between the two works." While it says that Tubbs’s work "often features discarded objects," it doesn’t provide details about the two works in question. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity." Instead, this choice shows how the works were produced at different times.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

As engineered structures, many bird nests are uniquely flexible yet cohesive. A research team led by Yashraj Bhosale wanted to better understand the mechanics behind these structural properties. Bhosale’s team used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks into nest-like structures. The researchers analyzed the points where sticks touched one another. When pressure was applied to the model nests, the number of contact points between the sticks increased, making the structures stiffer.  

The student wants to present the primary aim of the research study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Bhosale’s team wanted to better understand the mechanics behind bird nests’ uniquely flexible yet cohesive structural properties.  

B. The researchers used laboratory models that simulated the arrangement of flexible sticks and analyzed the points where sticks touched one another.  

C. After analyzing the points where sticks touched, the researchers found that the structures became stiffer when pressure was applied.  

D. As analyzed by Bhosale’s team, bird nests are uniquely flexible yet cohesive engineered structures.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. It describes the reason Bhosale’s team wanted to study the structures of bird nests— that is to say, the study’s primary aim.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t present the primary aim of the research study. It describes how the study worked, but not why it was done. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t present the primary aim of the research study. It describes a result of the experiment, but not why it was carried out. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t present the primary aim of the research study.  


# ID: 16631d34  

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

The Million Song Dataset (MSD) includes main audio features and descriptive tags for popular songs. Audio features include acoustic traits such as loudness and pitch intervals. Many algorithms use these audio features to predict a new song’s popularity. These algorithms may fail to accurately identify main audio features of a song with varying acoustic traits. Algorithms based on descriptive tags that describe fixed traits such as genre are more reliable predictors of song popularity.  

The student wants to explain a disadvantage of relying on audio features to predict a song’s popularity. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Many popularity-predicting algorithms are based on a song’s audio features, such as loudness and pitch intervals.  

B. Algorithms based on audio features may misidentify the main features of a song with varying acoustic traits, making such algorithms less reliable predictors of popularity than those based on fixed traits.  

C. Audio features describe acoustic traits such as pitch intervals, which may vary within a song, whereas descriptive tags describe fixed traits such as genre, which are reliable predictors of popularity.  

D. The MSD’s descriptive tags are reliable predictors of a song’s popularity, as the traits they describe are fixed.  


Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice uses relevant information from the notes to explain a disadvantage of relying on audio features to predict a song’s popularity—namely, that it may misidentify features of certain songs. It also contrasts audio features with descriptive tags, which are more reliable predictors.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice only states a fact about the algorithms without evaluating their reliability or accuracy. Choice C is incorrect. This choice only describes the difference between audio features and descriptive tags without indicating why this difference matters for predicting popularity. Choice D is incorrect. This choice only mentions descriptive tags, which are not the focus of the student’s rhetorical goal.  


# ID: 6c9df5d1  

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Some powerful works of literature have so influenced readers that new legislation has been passed as a result. The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789) is the autobiography of a man who endured slavery on both sides of the Atlantic. Equiano’s book contributed to the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807. The Jungle (1906) is a fictional work by Upton Sinclair that describes unsanitary conditions in US meatpacking plants. Sinclair’s book contributed to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906.  

The student wants to emphasize a difference between the two books. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Although both are powerful works of literature that contributed to new legislation, Equiano’s book is an autobiography, while Sinclair’s is fictional.  

B. They may have written about different topics, but Equiano and Sinclair both influenced readers.  

C. The 1807 Slave Trade Act resulted in part from a book by Equiano, while the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act resulted in part from a book by Sinclair.  

D. The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano and The Jungle are two works of literature that contributed to new legislation (concerning the slave trade and food safety, respectively).  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This choice emphasizes a difference between the two books by using relevant information from the notes to contrast their genres.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice mentions a difference between the books (their different topics), but it emphasizes a similarity between the books (their influence on readers). Choice C is incorrect. This choice provides information about the books that reflects both a similarity (both resulted in new laws) and a difference (the specific laws that resulted), without emphasizing either. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize a difference between the two books. Instead, it emphasizes a similarity.  


# ID: 64e88c58  

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

In 1971, experimental musician Pauline Oliveros created Sonic Meditations. Sonic Meditations is not music but rather a series of sound-based exercises called meditations. Each meditation consists of instructions for participants to make, imagine, listen to, or remember sounds. The instructions for Meditation V state, “walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears.” Those for Meditation XVIII state, “listen to a sound until you no longer recognize it.”  

The student wants to provide an explanation and an example of Oliveros’s Sonic Meditations. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Sonic Meditations is not music but rather a series of sound-based meditations that consist of instructions; Meditation XVIII, for instance, instructs participants to “listen to a sound until you no longer recognize it.”  

B. In 1971, Oliveros created Sonic Meditations, a series of meditations that consist of instructions for participants to make, imagine, listen to, or remember sounds.  

C. “Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears” is one example of the instructions found in Oliveros’s Sonic Meditations.  

D. While both meditations consist of instructions, Meditation XVIII instructs participants to “listen,” whereas Meditation V instructs participants to “walk.”  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. It describes what a “Sonic Meditation” is, and then gives an example in the form of Meditation XVIII.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice describes what a “Sonic Meditation” is, but doesn’t give an example of one. Choice C is incorrect. This choice gives an example of a “Sonic Meditation,” but doesn’t explain what the meditations are. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t describe what a “Sonic Meditation” is.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Freddie Wong (born 1985) is a director and special effects artist from the United States. He is best known for the action-comedy web series Video Game High School (VGHS). VGHS premiered in 2012 on RocketJump, a YouTube channel that Wong cocreated. The series was celebrated for its inventive video game–centric world and high-quality special effects. VGHS was nominated for a Producers Guild Award for Outstanding Digital Series.  

The student wants to begin a narrative about Wong’s award-nominated web series. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. In 2012, director and visual effects artist Freddie Wong launched a new action-comedy web series: Video Game High School.  

B. Video Game High School was celebrated for its inventive video game–centric world and high-quality special effects, and it was nominated for a Producer’s Guild Award for Outstanding Digital Series.  

C. Wong, cocreator of the YouTube channel RocketJump, would go on to see his web series be nominated for a Producers Guild Award.  

D. In 2012, Video Game High School premiered on RocketJump; it would later be nominated for an award.  


Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This choice introduces Wong and VGHS in an active and specific way, as if to an audience unfamiliar with the series. It also sets up the time and genre of the web series, which are useful ways to introduce the series of events in a narrative.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for beginning a narrative. A narrative is a story that follows a sequence of events and creates interest and suspense for the reader. This choice jumps to the end, explaining the success of VGHS without explaining what it is. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for beginning a narrative. It doesn’t actually introduce the web series by name. It just jumps to later in the story without sufficient explanation. Choice D is incorrect. This choice is not very effective for beginning a narrative. It doesn’t explain what VGHS is, and it doesn’t mention Wong.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

The popular wood-wide web theory posits that trees can communicate and exchange resources with one another via common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) of fungi. Ecologist Dr. Suzanne Simard first suggested this theory in 1997. She described trees as “super-co operators.” In the 2022 study “The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,” mycologist Dr. Justine Karst and colleagues evaluated dozens of CMN studies. They write that CMNs “have captured the interest of broad audiences. We are concerned, however, that recent claims about CMNs in forests are disconnected from evidence.”  

The student wants to use a quotation to emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Describing trees as “super-co operators,” Simard first suggested that trees can exchange resources with one another in 1997.  

B. In “The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,” Karst and colleagues note that common mycorrhizal networks “have captured the interest of broad audiences.”  

C. After evaluating dozens of CMN studies, Karst and colleagues expressed concern that recent claims about common mycorrhizal networks are “disconnected from evidence.”  

D. Despite the concerns expressed in the 2022 study “The Decay of the Wood-Wide Web?,” the wood-wide web theory remains popular.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice uses a quotation to convey the authors’ criticism and challenge to the wood-wide web theory due to an absence of evidence.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. It uses a quotation to introduce the theory and its originator. It doesn’t mention any criticism or challenge to the theory. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a quotation, but it doesn’t emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. It uses a quotation to describe the appeal and interest of the theory, but it doesn’t indicate why the authors are concerned or what evidence they have. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t use a quotation at all. It paraphrases the main idea of the 2022 study, but it doesn’t include any specific words or phrases from the notes. It also doesn’t emphasize a potential problem with the theory, but rather its popularity.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

A thermal inversion is a phenomenon where a layer of atmosphere is warmer than the layer beneath it. In 2022, a team of researchers studied the presence of thermal inversions in twenty-five gas giants. Gas giants are planets largely composed of helium and hydrogen. The team found that gas giants featuring a thermal inversion were also likely to contain heat-absorbing metals. One explanation for this relationship is that these metals may reside in a planet’s upper atmosphere, where their absorbed heat causes an increase in temperature.  

The student wants to present the study’s findings to an audience already familiar with thermal inversions. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Heat-absorbing metals may reside in a planet’s upper atmosphere. B. The team studied thermal inversions in twenty-five gas giants, which are largely composed of helium and hydrogen.  

C. Researchers found that gas giants featuring a thermal inversion were likely to contain heat-absorbing metals, which may reside in the planets’ upper atmospheres.  

D. Gas giants were likely to contain heat-absorbing metals when they featured a layer of atmosphere warmer than the layer beneath it, researchers found; this phenomenon is known as a thermal inversion.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. It describes the study’s findings in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with thermal inversions.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t fully describe the findings of the study, because it doesn’t include anything about thermal inversions. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t describe the study’s findings. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for an audience already familiar with thermal inversion. A familiar audience wouldn’t need to have the term defined.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

A commodity chain is the series of links connecting the production and purchase of a commodity on the world market. Chinese American anthropologist Anna Tsing studies the contemporary commodity chain of matsutake mushrooms. At one end of the matsutake chain are mushroom pickers in Oregon. At the other end are wealthy consumers who buy the costly matsutake in Japan. According to Tsing, “Japanese traders began importing matsutake in the 1980s, when the scarcity of matsutake in Japan first became clear.”  

The student wants to provide an overview of the matsutake commodity chain. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. The contemporary matsutake commodity chain has its origins in the 1980s when, according to Tsing, “the scarcity of matsutake in Japan first became clear.”  

B. Commodity chains include the linked production and purchase of commodities, such as the matsutake mushroom, on the world market.  

C. Decades after the Japanese import of matsutake began, a commodity chain now links matsutake pickers in Oregon with wealthy consumers of the costly mushrooms in Japan.  

D. Wealthy consumers who buy the costly mushrooms in Japan are at one end of the matsutake commodity chain.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The sentence provides an overview of the matsutake commodity chain, connecting the Oregon mushroom pickers at one end to the Japanese consumers at the other.  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the matsutake commodity chain, it focuses only on its origins; it does not provide an overview. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides a general definition of commodity chains, not an overview of the matsutake chain. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the matsutake commodity chain, it focuses only on one end of the chain (the consumers); it does not provide an overview.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Archaeologist Jon Erlandson and colleagues argue that humans first arrived in the Americas by sea. They propose that humans traveled between Pacific Ocean islands and coastlines from northeast Asia to the Americas. Many of these islands and coastal zones were later submerged as glaciers melted and sea levels rose. The researchers think that   $"{\sf a}$   coastal route, including kelp forests and estuaries, would have provided a rich mix of marine, estuarine, riverine, and terrestrial resources” such as seaweeds, fish, and birds. This proposed scenario is known as the kelp highway hypothesis.  

The student wants to summarize the kelp highway hypothesis. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Pacific Ocean islands and coastlines likely contained  $"{\sf a}$   rich mix of marine, estuarine, riverine, and terrestrial resources” such as seaweeds, fish, and birds, according to researchers.  

B. One argument about how humans first arrived in the Americas is the kelp highway hypothesis proposed by Jon Erlandson and colleagues.  

C. Humans may have first arrived in the Americas by sea, traveling between Pacific Ocean islands and coastlines and subsisting on a variety of resources.  

D. As glaciers melted and sea levels rose, many Pacific Ocean islands and coastal zones were submerged.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice summarizes the main idea of the kelp highway hypothesis, providing a high-level overview of how the hypothesis explains human migration to the Americas.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice describes one aspect of the proposed scenario but doesn’t discuss human migration, which is the main focus of the kelp highway hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect. This choice introduces the kelp highway hypothesis but doesn’t explain what it entails. Choice D is incorrect. This choice describes one element of the proposed scenario but doesn’t discuss human migration, which is the main focus of the kelp highway hypothesis.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Neuroscientists Krishnan Padma nab han and Zhen Chen sought to better understand the workings of the brain’s olfactory system. They devised a study using mathematical models. They found that certain fibers allow the brain to toggle from one method of processing smells to another. In one method, cells in the piriform cortex (where the perception of odor forms) capture olfactory information at a given moment. In the other, the cells track changes in olfactory information over time.  

The student wants to summarize the study’s findings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. To arrive at these findings, which describe dual methods of processing smells in the piriform cortex, Padma nab han and Chen devised a study using mathematical models.  

B. Padma nab han and Chen showed that olfactory information is captured by cells in the piriform cortex, where the perception of odor forms.  

C. Using mathematical models, Padma nab han and Chen devised a study to better understand the workings of the brain’s olfactory system.  

D. According to Padma nab han and Chen, the brain can toggle between capturing olfactory information at a given moment and tracking changes in that information over time.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence effectively summarizes the study’s findings, explaining what Padma nab han and Chen found: that the brain can toggle between one method of processing smells (capturing information at a given moment) and another (tracking changes in information over time).  

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions findings, it mainly focuses on Padma nab han and Chen’s methodology. It doesn’t effectively summarize the study’s findings. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence notes a fact about the olfactory system—that the perception of odor forms in the piriform cortex—but doesn’t summarize the findings of Padma nab han and Chen’s study. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence presents the goal of Padma nab han and Chen’s study; it doesn’t summarize the study’s findings.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

N is solo gist s are scientists who study islands. Some n is solo gist s define an island as any piece of land surrounded by water. Using that definition, they determined that Sweden has 221,000 islands. Other n is solo gist s define an island as being 1 kilometer square, a certain distance from the mainland, and having at least 50 permanent residents. Using that definition, they determined that Sweden has 24 islands.  

The student wants to make and support a generalization about n is solo gist s’ definition of an island. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish these goals?  

A. The definition of an island as any piece of land surrounded by water is supported by some n is solo gist s, scientists who study islands.  

B. Multiple counts of Sweden’s islands have been based on different definitions of an island. C. Based on a recent count, Sweden has a relatively small number of islands with at least 50 permanent residents.  

D. N is solo gist s’ different definitions can result in huge disparities in counts of islands, as the example of Sweden shows.  


Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about n is solo gist s’ definition of an island— specifically, that the use of one definition rather than another can result in huge disparities in the number of islands counted—and supports that generalization by citing Sweden as an example.  

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence introduces one definition of an island to an audience unfamiliar with n is solo gist s; it doesn’t make a generalization about n is solo gist s’ definition of an island. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence synthesizes information from the notes about counts of Sweden’s islands, it doesn’t make and support a generalization about n is solo gist s’ definition of an island. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes an inference about islands in Sweden; it doesn’t mention n is solo gist s’ definition of an island or make a generalization about it.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

In 1978, Sámi activists staged protests to block the construction of a dam on the Alta River in Norway. The dam would disrupt Sámi fishing and reindeer herding. The dam was ultimately built, but the Alta conflict had a lasting impact. It brought international attention to the issue of Sámi rights. It led to a set of 2005 legal protections establishing Sámi rights to lands, waters, and resources.  

The student wants to make and support a generalization about the Alta conflict. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. During the Alta conflict, Sámi activists staged protests to block the construction of a dam on the Alta River in Norway that would disrupt local fishing and reindeer herding.  

B. Although the dam that the Sámi activists had protested was ultimately built, the Alta conflict had a lasting impact.  

C. Sámi rights to lands, waters, and resources received international attention and legal protections as a result of the Alta conflict.  

D. The Alta conflict had a lasting impact, resulting in international attention and legal protections for Sámi rights to lands, waters, and resources.  


Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. It makes a generalization—the conflict had a lasting impact—and then supports it with evidence—the attention and protections were results of the conflict.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t make a generalization about the conflict. It describes a specific event from the conflict. Choice B is incorrect. This choice makes a generalization about the Alta conflict, but doesn’t support it. Choice C is incorrect. This choice makes a statement about the aftermath of the conflict, but doesn’t support it. The statement is also a little too specific to be a generalization.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:  

Stars form in a galaxy when gravity causes a massive cloud of dust and gas to collapse. A galaxy in a phase of rapid star formation is called a starburst galaxy. Quenching is a process in which a galaxy loses star-forming gas. A galaxy that no longer forms stars is called a quenched galaxy. A quenched galaxy has entered the post star burst phase.  

The student wants to explain what a quenched galaxy is. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  

A. Before quenching, a starburst galaxy will form stars at a rapid rate.  

B. When it becomes quenched, a starburst galaxy enters the post star burst phase. C. Having entered the post star burst phase, a quenched galaxy is one that no longer forms stars. D. A starburst galaxy will lose star-forming gas and eventually become quenched.  


Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice defines a quenched galaxy as “one that no longer forms stars.”  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice only describes what happens before quenching. Choice B is incorrect. This choice only describes what happens after quenching. Choice D is incorrect. This choice only describes what causes quenching.
