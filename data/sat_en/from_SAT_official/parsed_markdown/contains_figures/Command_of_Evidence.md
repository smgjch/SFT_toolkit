Roasted green chiles are a popular ingredient in Southwestern cuisine, but the traditional roasting method of burning propane is not environmentally friendly. To see if solar power could provide a better alternative, engineer Kenneth Armijo and his team roasted batches of green chiles using between 38 and 42 heliostats, which are devices that concentrate sunlight. The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found that propane yielded faster results. While the fastest solar-roasted green chiles took six minutes, batches using propane took only four. Armijo hypothesizes that they can reduce the roasting time for solar-roasted green chiles by using more heliostats.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Armijo’s hypothesis?  

A. The temperature inside the roasting drum is distributed more evenly when roasting green chiles with solar power than with propane.  

B. Attempts to roast green chiles using 50 heliostats yields results in fewer than six minutes.  

C. Green chile connoisseurs prefer the flavor of solar-roasted green chiles over the flavor of propane-roasted green chiles.  

D. The skins of solar-roasted green chiles are easier to peel than the skins of propane-roasted green chiles.

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. Armijo believes that using more heliostats will speed up the roasting process, and this finding shows that with 50 heliostats—more than the number of heliostats already used—the roasting time is indeed reduced.  

Choice A is incorrect. The evenness of temperature in the roasting drum doesn’t tell us about the speed of the roasting process, which is what Armijo’s hypothesis is concerned with. Choice C is incorrect. Armijo’s hypothesis is focused on the speed of the roasting process, not the flavor of the resulting roasted chiles. Choice D is incorrect. Though Armijo’s hypothesis mentions a benefit of solar-roasting green chiles (easier peeling), it doesn’t address the speed of the roasting process.

Electric companies that use wind turbines rely on weather forecasts to predict the maximum amount of power, in megawatt-hours (MWh), they can generate using wind so that they can determine how much they’ll need to generate from other sources. When winds are stronger than they were forecast to be, however, the predicted maximum amount of electricity wind turbines could generate will be too low. For example, the graph shows that for the West region, the winds were ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example? A. strong enough to generate about 150 thousand more MWh of electricity from wind turbines. B. so weak that the electricity from wind turbines was about 175 thousand MWh less than predicted. C. so weak that the electricity from wind turbines was about 150 thousand MWh less than predicted. D. strong enough to generate about 175 thousand more MWh of electricity from wind turbines.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The claim is that when winds are stronger than forecasted, wind turbines can generate more energy than predicted. The supporting graph shows the additional amount (above the predicted amount) that the turbines generated under those conditions, with the West generating about 150 thousand additional MWh.  
Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the example. The graph shows the additional amount of electricity that the wind turbines generated. The West bar is greater than 0, so the West generated more than the predicted amount. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the example. The graph shows the additional amount of electricity that the wind turbines generated. The West bar is greater than 0, so the West generated more than the predicted amount. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The graph shows us that the West (the bar on the left) generated about 150 thousand additional MWh.

The table shows data from paleontologist Angélica Torices and colleagues’ 2021 study of two sets of dinosaur tracks preserved in a fossilized lake bed in Spain. The tracks, referred to as La Torre 6A and La Torre 6B, were left by two individual theropods (dinosaurs that walked on two legs). The team’s findings suggest that of the two theropods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a higher maximum mean speed, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the claim?  

A. a longer footprint, and a longer average stride. B. a longer footprint, and a shorter average stride. C. a shorter footprint, and a longer average stride. D. a shorter footprint, and a shorter average stride.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5b4406b5e31b352bbdf1e31936bed4eb132cecc8a903d69c3133bd753fd9b22b.jpg)  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the claim about the tracks left by two therapods. The table indicates that the set of tracks labeled La Torre 6A has an estimated footprint length of 32.8 centimeters, an average stride length of 5.23 meters, and an estimated mean speed of 6.5–10.3 meters per second. For the set of tracks labeled La Torre 6B, on the other hand, the estimated footprint length is 28.9 centimeters, the average stride length is 5.57 meters, and the estimated mean speed is 8.8–12.4 meters per second. Therefore, the therapod that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a shorter footprint and a longer average stride than the one that left the La Torre 6A tracks.  

Choice A is incorrect. While it is true that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a longer average stride, it didn’t have a longer footprint: the table shows that its estimated footprint length is 28.9 centimeters, while La Torre 6A’s estimated footprint length is 32.8 centimeters. Choice B is incorrect because the table shows that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a footprint length estimated at 28.9 centimeters, which is shorter than the 32.8 centimeters estimated for the other set of tracks. Moreover, the therapod that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a longer average stride, not shorter: 5.57 meters, compared with 5.23 meters for the other set of tracks. Choice D is incorrect. While it is true that of the two therapods, the one that left the La Torre 6B tracks had a shorter footprint, it didn’t have a shorter average stride: the table shows that its average stride length is 5.57 meters, while La Torre 6A’s average stride length is 5.23 meters.

The Navajo Nation has the largest land area of any tribal nation in the United States: over 27,000 square miles in the Southwest. Because this area is so huge and its communities are located at various elevations, the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. For example, in July, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement? A. the lowest temperature for both Cameron and Teec Nos Pos was   $65^{\circ}$  . B. Tuba City’s average highest temperature was  $94^{\circ},$   while Teec Nos Pos’s was  $93^{\circ}$  . C. Ramah’s average highest temperature was   $83\%$   while Cameron’s was   $99^{\circ}$  . D. the lowest temperature for both Ramah and Tuba City was  $50^{\circ}.$  .

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement, providing an example of how the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live. The table shows the average highest temperatures and average lowest temperatures in four locations in the Navajo Nation in July. According to the table, Ramah’s average highest temperature for July was   $83^{\circ}$  , whereas Cameron’s average highest temperature was much higher, at   $99^{\circ}$  . This difference illustrates the statement that the people of the Navajo Nation can experience different climate conditions depending on where they live.  

Choice A is incorrect because it states that Cameron and Teec Nos Pos had the same average lowest temperature   $\left(65^{\circ}\right)$   for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data from the table, which shows that the  
average highest temperature in July for Tuba City was  $83^{\circ},$  , not  $94^{\circ},$  , and for Teec Nos Pos it was  $94^{\circ},$  , not  $93^{\circ}$  . Even if the cited data accurately reflected the data in the table, the similarity between the two values for average highest temperature would suggest that people in the two locations likely experience similar climate conditions, not different climate conditions. Choice D is incorrect because it states that Ramah and Tuba City had the same average lowest temperature   $(50^{\circ})$   for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference.

As a monthly newsletter formed in 1969 by a group of Asian American students at the University of California, Los Angeles, Gidra helped raise awareness about social and political issues concerning the Asian American community on campus and at large. The newsletter had an expansive reach for a publication of its kind: around 4,000 copies were published each month. A student writing a history paper, however, hypothesizes that Gidra’s influence cannot be measured by the number of newsletters published monthly alone.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the student’s hypothesis? A. The students who initially formed Gidra each contributed financially to its creation. B. In addition to covering current events, Gidra also featured works of art and literature. C. Gidra was initially based out of the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA. D. People would often give their copies of Gidra to others once they had finished reading an issue.  

# ID: e7dc27dc Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. If there were more Gidra readers than there were copies of the newsletter, then the newsletter’s influence would be much greater than its 4,000 monthly copies.  

Choice A is incorrect. Information about the newsletter’s initial funding doesn’t tell us about the influence that the newsletter eventually had. Choice B is incorrect. While the content of Gidra was undoubtedly related to the newsletter’s influence, this information isn’t relevant to the specific hypothesis about monthly circulation numbers. Choice C is incorrect. Where the publishers of Gidra were initially based doesn’t tell us about the newsletter’s overall influence.

Copper Production for Three States, 1889-1909  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/9aa9bb7b7b0468fc72782df5c6c3b7d7b8f8f6c02833645ba11aaf013bb89bbf.jpg)  
Copper had been mined in the US for thousands of years, but large-scale commercial mining of copper took off starting in the late 1800s. This was due to several factors. Technological advancements in the mining industry led to improvements in the production of copper. This helped the country keep up with the growing number of people wanting to buy copper starting in the 1890s. At the same time, the growth of the railroad system made the transportation of copper in large batches much easier. Several states saw rapid growth in the production of this resource, for example: ______  

Which choice most effectively uses the data in the graph to complete the example?  

A. The rise in copper production in Michigan slowed from 1902 to 1909. B. Montana and Arizona produced more copper than Michigan did in 1909. C. Fewer than 100 million pounds of copper were produced in Arizona in 1889. D. Copper production rose significantly from 1889 to 1909 for Arizona, Michigan, and Montana.  
Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text asks us to provide examples of several states that saw rapid growth in copper production from the 1890s onward. The graph depicts Arizona, Michigan, and Montana all experiencing such rapid growth during this time period.  

Choice A is incorrect. The claim is about states experiencing rapid growth in copper production. This statement only discusses one state and does not provide evidence of rapid growth—in fact, it discusses a slowdown of growth. Choice B is incorrect. The claim is about states experiencing rapid growth in copper production, and this statement provides a comparison of production rates between states, rather than an example of rapid growth. Choice C is incorrect. The claim is about several states experiencing rapid growth in copper production. This statement only discusses one state and does not provide evidence of growth in copper production.

Nan Gao and her team conducted multiple surveys to determine participants’ levels of comfort in a room where the temperature was regulated by a commercial climate control system. Participants filled out surveys several times a day to indicate their level of comfort on a scale from  $^{-3}$   (very cold) to  $^{+3}$   (very hot), with 0 indicating neutral (neither warm nor cool), and to indicate how they would prefer the temperature to be adjusted. The table shows three participants’ responses in one of the surveys. According to the table, all three participants wanted the room to be cooler, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. and they each reported the same level of comfort. B. even though each participant’s ratings varied throughout the day. C. but participant 20 reported feeling significantly colder than the other two participants did. D. but participant 1 reported feeling warmer than the other two participants did.  

# ID: 4042ff0b Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The text describes the comfort rating scale: from   $^{-3}$   (very cold) to  $+3$   (very hot), with 0 being neutral. Participant 20 gave a   $^{-2}$   comfort rating, a full three points colder on the scale than the other two participants.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Participant 1 and participant 21 reported the same level of comfort, but participant  $20\,\mathrm{{s}}$   comfort level was three points lower. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t use data from the table. The table only shows us one survey, so we don’t know if the participants’ ratings varied throughout the day. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Participant 1 and participant 21 reported the same level of comfort.

Many scientists have believed that giraffes are solitary creatures, preferring to spend their time alone instead of with others. But observations of giraffes and their behavior in recent years has suggested that these animals may be more social than we once thought. For example, scientists Zoe Muller and Stephen Harris claim that giraffes may even help each other care for one another’s newborns.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Muller and Harris’s  conclusion?  

A. Female giraffes have been observed feeding young giraffes that aren’t their direct offspring. B. Confrontations between a younger and an older male giraffe are frequently observed. C. Some female giraffes have been observed sniffing and licking their newborn offspring.  

D. Giraffes are able to make sounds but are rarely observed communicating with others.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. If female giraffes feed non offspring young, that’s direct evidence that "giraffes may even help each other care for one another’s newborns."  

Choice B is incorrect. Confrontations between males doesn’t tell us anything about whether giraffes help each other care for newborns. Choice C is incorrect. While this option does mention newborn offspring, it only discusses a mother’s behavior toward her own child, not another giraffe’s child. Choice D is incorrect. Whether or not giraffes are observed communicating with each other doesn’t tell us anything about whether they help each other care for newborns.

By the early 1900s, the Singer Corporation, a US sewing machine manufacturer founded in 1851, began to see rapidly increasing sales abroad, particularly in Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These markets were responsible for the bulk of Singer’s overseas sales, but demand for the company’s machines in other countries also grew significantly in the early twentieth century. For instance, sales of their sewing machines in ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example?  

A. the Philippines increased dramatically from 1908 to 1918. B. New Zealand were largely consistent from 1903 to 1918. C. Australia increased steadily from 1903 to 1918. D. Turkey declined substantially from 1913 to 1918.  
Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom.  

Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand.

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because this quotation most effectively illustrates the claim that the author emphasizes the near silence of the setting where the character Valia is reading. In the quotation, the author highlights the near silence of the setting by twice using the word “quiet” to describe the room. The author also calls attention to the fact that Valia is reading in a nearly silent setting by noting that the only sound to be heard is that of the pages being turned.  

Choice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that Valia is in a chilly setting that causes his hand to become cold, not that he’s in a nearly silent setting. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation emphasizes the size of the book Valia is reading, not a quality of the setting where he’s reading it. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation describes Valia approaching a window and looking at toys, not reading in a quiet setting.

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. Eris and Makemake. B. Haumea and Eris. C. Pluto and Haumea. D. Makemake and Ceres.  

# ID: c4bee178 Answer  

Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement about dwarf planets that have exactly one moon. The table lists several dwarf planets in one column and the number of moons that each of those dwarf planets has in another column. The text states that some dwarf planets have exactly one moon and indicates that there are two examples. Only two dwarf planets in the table have exactly one moon: Eris and Makemake.  

Choice B is incorrect. According to the table, Eris has exactly one moon, but Haumea has two moons. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, Haumea has two moons, and Pluto has five moons. Thus, they are not examples of dwarf planets with exactly one moon. Choice D is incorrect because while the table indicates that Makemake has exactly one moon, the table shows that Ceres has no moons at all.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This choice illustrates both “feeling frightened in controlled situations” (the haunted house) and the benefit of a boosted mood (“less stressed”) and confidence (“very accomplished”).  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. While laughing may indicate a good mood, this choice provides no evidence of “feeling frightened” or boosted confidence. Another choice provides better evidence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. This choice demonstrates “feeling frightened” in a controlled environment, but it doesn’t provide strong evidence of boosted mood or confidence. Another choice provides better evidence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn’t the best illustration of the claim. While a “sense of relief” could be interpreted as a boosted mood, this choice doesn’t provide direct evidence of “feeling frightened” or of increased confidence. This choice simply suggests that haunted houses and scary movies have a similar effect. Another choice provides better evidence for the researcher’s claim.

Investigative journalists research and report about fraud, corruption, public hazards, and more. The graph shows the number of investigative articles published in the Albuquerque Journal newspaper from 2010 to 2019. According to an analyst, although the number of investigative articles published in this newspaper has varied significantly over the period shown, the number overall has fallen since 2010.  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to justify the underlined claim? A. The newspaper published approximately 1,000 investigative articles in 2010 and approximately 500 in 2019.  

B. The smallest annual number of investigative articles published in the newspaper during the period shown is approximately 1,600 in 2013.  

C. The greatest annual number of investigative articles published in the newspaper during the period shown is approximately 1,000 in 2017.  

D. The newspaper published approximately 1,000 investigative articles in 2010 and approximately 1,600 in 2013.  

# ID: e441da80 Answer  

Rationale  
Choice A is the best answer. By comparing the number of investigative articles in 2010 to the number in 2019, we can see that the number has fallen overall.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The 1,600 articles published in 2013 was the largest annual number of investigative articles published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year. Choice C is incorrect. The 1,000 articles published in 2017 wasn’t the largest number published during the period. Also, notice that the claim focuses on an overall change, while this choice just focuses on one year. We can’t determine an overall increase or decrease by looking at just one year. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the claim. The claim is about a decrease in articles published between 2010 and 2019. This data shows an increase in articles published over a different period (2010-2013).

A museum curator is writing a biographical statement about Trinidadian-born Chinese dancer, choreographer, and teacher Dai Ailian for a new exhibit on Chinese dance. The curator claims that some of the pieces Dai created shortly after arriving in mainland China in 1941, such as the solo dance Yao Drum, reflect a desire to represent the dances of local communities Dai visited during her travels through China.  

Which quotation from a work by a dance historian would be the most effective evidence for the curator to include in support of this claim?  

A. “There is no sound or music accompanying Dai’s movements in Yao Drum, aside from the sounds of drumsticks beating against a drum and against each other.”  

B. “Unlike some of the works Dai created in the early 1940s, Yao Drum does not feature a narrative structure, humorous elements, or references to real-life events.”  

C. “Yao Drum was inspired by a ceremonial dance Dai witnessed during her time performing field research among the Yao people in the province of Guizhou in 1941 or 1942.”  

D. “Yao Drum is notable for its intense physical it y, with Dai performing sharp jumps, swift turns, and dramatic sweeps of her legs through the air as she moves in circles on the stage.”  

# ID: 08ff903e Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice clearly states that Yao Drum was inspired by a ceremonial dance of the Yao people. This directly supports the curator’s claim that some of Dai’s pieces “represent the dances of local communities” she visited.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice discusses the sound and music in Yao Drum, but it doesn’t connect these elements to “the dances of local communities,” which is the focus of the claim. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t mention the dances of local communities, but instead discusses how Yao Drum is different from some of Dai’s earlier works. Choice D is incorrect. This choice describes the choreography of Yao Drum, but it doesn’t connect these elements to “the dances of local communities,” which is the focus of the claim.

“The Rock and the  $\mathsf{S e a^{\prime\prime}}$   is an 1893 poem by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. In the poem, a rock is portrayed as intending to confront and restrain the sea: ______  

Which quotation from “The Rock and the Sea” most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “I am the Rock. Black midnight falls; / The terrible breakers rise like walls; / With curling lips and gleaming teeth / They plunge and tear at my bones beneath.” B. “I am the Sea. I hold the land / As one holds an apple in his hand, / Hold it fast with sleepless eyes, / Watching the continents sink and rise.” C. “I am the Rock, presumptuous Sea! / I am set to encounter thee. / Angry and loud or gentle and still, / I am set here to limit thy power, and I will!” D. “I am the Sea. The earth I sway; / Granite to me is potter’s clay; / Under the touch of my careless waves / It  

rises in turrets and sinks in caves.”  

# ID: 47f2cddd Answer  

Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This quotation focuses on the rock, which yells at the sea and announces its intent to “limit [the sea’s] power.” This matches the idea of confrontation and restraint in the claim we’re trying to support.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. While this quotation does focus on the rock, it suggests that the rock fears the sea. It lacks the sense of boldness and strength implied by the phrase “confront and restrain the sea.” Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t illustrate the claim. This quotation focuses on the sea, not the rock.

Hip-hop pedagogy is a form of teaching that’s gaining popularity across school subjects. It involves incorporating hip-hop and rap music into lessons as well as using hip-hop elements when teaching other subject matters. For example, Quan Neloms’s students look for college-level vocabulary and historical events in rap songs. Researchers claim that in addition to developing students’ social justice awareness, hip-hop pedagogy encourages student success by raising students’ interest and engagement.  

Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined claim? A. Students tend to be more enthusiastic about rap music than they are about hip-hop music.  

B. Students who are highly interested in social justice issues typically don’t sign up for courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap music.  

C. Educators report that they enjoy teaching courses that involve hip-hop and rap music more than teaching courses that don’t.  

D. Courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap music are among the courses with the highest enrollment and attendance rates.

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. Enrollment and attendance are logical ways to measure whether students are interested and engaged. High enrollment and attendance suggests a high level of interest and engagement.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Students’ preferences between hip-hop and rap aren’t relevant to the claim, which is focused on whether or not students like classes that use hip-hop pedagogy (which includes the educational use of both hip-hop and rap). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. While the first part of the sentence discusses social justice, the underlined claim focuses on student success, which is unrelated. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. This tells us about teacher enjoyment, which isn’t relevant to a claim about student interest and engagement.

Number of Young Fish Collected at Mangrove Sites in the Egyptian Red Sea During Three Seasons of 2010  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/dffe28fe8cbba770c851cfb5187dcaaf6aa972ec2526c730e55105197a9976d5.jpg)  

Mangroves are trees or bushes that grow on the coastlines of seas and rivers. Areas with mangroves are great places for young fish since they help keep these fish fed and protected while they grow. To study the importance of mangroves to young fish, researchers Mohamed A.Abu El-Regal and Nesreen K. Ibrahim collected and identified young fish from three different mangrove sites in the Egyptian Red Sea. They collected fish in the winter, spring, and autumn of 2010, collecting a total of 269 fish from 21 different species. For some species, more fish were collected in the winter than the other two seasons, for instance: ______  

Which choice most effectively uses the data in the graph to complete the example?  

A. more common silver-biddy and milkfish were collected in the winter than in either of the other two seasons. B. the common silver-biddy was collected more frequently than the other two species in all three seasons. C. in the spring, researchers collected more Red Sea goldfish than they collected from the other two species. D. in the fall, researchers collected 10 common silver-biddy but collected no milkfish or Red Sea goatfish.  
Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The claim is about which fish were collected more in winter than in other seasons. By comparing the number of common silver-biddy and milkfish collected in each season, we can see that more of these fish were collected in winter than in any other season.  

Choice B is incorrect. The claim is about which fish were collected more in winter than in other seasons. This statement compares collections across the three species of fish, rather than comparing collections of individual types of fish across seasons. Choice C is incorrect. The claim is about which fish were collected more in winter than in other seasons. This statement is about spring, rather than winter. Choice D is incorrect. The claim is about which fish were collected more in winter than in other seasons. This statement is about fall, rather than winter, fish collections.

American fashion designer Patrick Kelly was known for his love of colorful buttons. Many of his signature dresses feature bold assortments of buttons throughout the garment. In a paper, a fashion design student claims that Kelly’s use of buttons as decoration was inspired by his childhood observations of the styles and actions of the women in his family.  

Which quotation from a work by a historian would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?  

A. “Although some of the assortments of buttons appear to be mismatched pieces scattered randomly throughout Kelly’s dresses, his most famous designs feature carefully crafted patterns of matching buttons.”  

B. “Many of Kelly’s contemporaries were inspired by his designs to incorporate buttons, as well as zippers and snaps, as decorative items in their work.”  

C. “Kelly’s grandmother, who would repair clothing when he was a child, frequently added mismatched buttons to the clothes to draw attention away from any flaws in the garments.”  

D. “Kelly was destined to be a designer from a young age: he learned how to sew clothing from his aunt Bertha, and his love of drawing was developed by his mother.”  

# ID: 0113152f Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This quotation draws a direct connection between the use of buttons and Kelly’s stylish female relatives.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice mentions Kelly’s use of buttons, but it doesn’t connect that design choice to the influence of women in Kelly’s family. Choice B is incorrect. This choice discusses how other designers were inspired by Kelly, which doesn’t provide evidence that Kelly was inspired by his family. Choice D is incorrect. While this choice does refer to fashionable women in Kelly’s family, it doesn’t connect their influence to Kelly’s use of buttons.

In addition to her technical skill and daring feats, American stunt pilot Bessie Coleman was also known for dazzling the crowds that came to watch her air shows in the 1920s with her exuberant personality. During her career, she was careful and purposeful about how she crafted her public persona. An aviation researcher has claimed that Coleman intentionally defied social norms of the time by how she chose to present herself to the public.  

Which quotation from an article about Coleman would most directly support the aviation researcher’s claim?  

A. “For her air shows, Coleman frequently used the Curtiss JN-4, or ‘Jenny,’ which at that time was one of the most well-known types of planes.”  

B. “While Coleman was beloved by spectators for her charisma, she had a more complicated relationship with her managers and staff, who at times found her behavior too impulsive and demanding.”  

C. “Coleman once considered leaving her career as a stunt pilot to focus her efforts on giving speeches, which she felt would better support her public image.”  

D. “Although female pilots were typically expected to wear traditional but impractical attire that included dresses or skirts, photographs of Coleman show her wearing pants and leather jackets.”  

# ID: f38b40ac Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This choice supports the claim of Coleman’s intentional defiance of social norms: female pilots were expected to wear skirts, but Coleman wore pants and leather jackets instead.  

Choice A is incorrect. Coleman flew a well-known, common plane, which would not have defied social norms among pilots. Choice B is incorrect. Her complicated relationship with managers and staff would not have been a component of Coleman’s public persona. This choice also fails to mention any “social norms of the time.” Choice C is incorrect. While this quotation suggests that Coleman was careful and purposeful about her public image, it doesn’t directly mention anything about “social norms of the time.”

Digital paywalls restrict access to online content to those with a paid subscription. In an investigation of the effect of paywalls on newspaper company revenues for print and digital subscriptions and advertising, Doug J. Chung and colleagues compared actual outcomes (with a paywall) to control estimates (without a paywall). The researchers concluded that introducing a paywall is generally more beneficial for larger newspapers, which have high circulation and tend to offer a substantial amount of unique online content.  

Which choice best describes data from the table that support Chung and colleagues’ conclusion?  

A. The Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times had similar total revenue changes, but the Los Angeles Times had a smaller percentage change.  

B. The Los Angeles Times had a  $12.5\%$   revenue change, while the Chicago Tribune had a   $19\%$   revenue change. C. The New York Times had a  $20\%$   revenue change, while the Denver Post had a   $-\uparrow\%$   revenue change.  

D. The Denver Post had only a  $-\uparrow\%$   revenue change, which was the smallest percentage change of the selected companies.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. Females only traveled 9.28 km per day in the cold-dry season, versus 12.64 and  $12.48\;\mathrm{km}$   per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. Males only traveled 15.81 km per day per day in the cold-dry season, versus 18.93 and 18.87 km per day in the monsoon and hot-dry seasons, respectively. So, the cold-dry season was the season where both males and females had the least daily travel.  

Choice B is incorrect. Although females traveled least in the cold-dry season, males didn’t travel least in the hot-dry season. Instead, they traveled less per day in the cold-dry season as well. Choice C is incorrect. Females had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the hot-dry season (9.28 versus  $12.48\;\mathrm{km}$   per day), and males had less daily travel in the cold-dry season than in the monsoon season (15.81 versus  $18.93\,\mathrm{km}$   per day).

The survey indicated the highest level of demand, with 88 percent of the residents interested in adding more bike paths, is in the city’s ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. South West area. B. South Central area. C. North East area. D. North Central area.  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement about the bike path survey. The table presents the percent of residents from five city areas who are in favor of adding more bike paths. With 88 percent of residents in favor of adding bike paths, the city’s South West area has the highest level of demand.  

Choice B is incorrect because, according to the data in the table, 33 percent of residents in the South Central area of the city are in favor of additional bike paths. The area of the city that has 88 percent of its surveyed residents in favor of additional bike paths will best complete the statement. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the data in the table, 12 percent of residents in the North East area of the city are in favor of additional bike paths. The area of the city that has 88 percent of its surveyed residents in favor of additional bike paths will best complete the statement. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the data in the table, 26 percent of residents in the North Central area of the city are in favor of additional bike paths. The area of  
the city that has 88 percent of its surveyed residents in favor of additional bike paths will best complete the statement.

The Milky Way galaxy is composed of millions of stars in a relatively flat structure containing a thin disk and a thick disk. Based on computer simulations and analysis of data on the brightness, position, and chemical composition of about 250,000 stars in the thick disk (collected from two telescopes, one in China and one orbiting in space), astrophysicists Maosheng Xiang and Hans-Walter Rix claim that the thick disk of the Milky Way formed in two distinct phases rather than a single one.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ claim?  

A. The telescopes used by the researchers have detected stars of similar ages in galaxies other than the Milky Way.  

B. There’s an age difference of about 2 billion years between certain stars in the thick disk. C. The thin disk contains about twice as many stars that can be seen from Earth as the thick disk does. D. The stars in the Milky Way tend to have very similar chemical compositions.  

# ID: 7fdba7ad Answer  

Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. A consistent age difference of 2 billion years between certain stars within the thick disk would support the claim that the thick disk formed in two phases instead of one, with the second phase beginning 2 billion years after the first phase.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. The researchers base their claim on their study of stars inside the thick disk of the Milky Way. This choice makes a comparison to stars in other galaxies, which isn’t relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. The researchers base their claim on their study of stars inside the thick disk. This choice makes a comparison to the thin disk, which isn’t relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It’s too general. The claim is specifically about the thick disk.

Some residents in a neighborhood in Atlanta recently founded a community garden inside a local park. The residents agreed to volunteer to take care of the garden together. Students at a local high school surveyed some of the volunteers as part of a project to understand the impact of the new garden. The students concluded that the new garden benefited the community overall by fostering connections and relationships between the volunteers and other residents of the neighborhood who weren’t volunteering at the garden.  

Which quotation from a survey respondent would best illustrate the students’ conclusion?  

A. “Our first challenge was deciding what plants would be most suitable to the climate and soil here in Atlanta. We needed plants that could survive the hot and humid summers.”  

B. “We’re lucky to have a few expert gardeners living in the neighborhood. Some volunteers and I have gone to them a few times with questions, and they’ve been eager to help us and to learn more about the project.”

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice shows how volunteers have been interacting with non volunteer neighbors and benefiting from their gardening expertise: proof of the connections enabled by the garden.  

Choice A is incorrect. This volunteer describes the challenges of developing the garden, which isn’t connected to the conclusion about the garden fostering connections between volunteers and neighbors. Choice C is incorrect. While the volunteer expresses enthusiasm for the garden, they don’t mention any interactions with other people, which is what the students need to show for their conclusion. Choice D is incorrect. The respondent enjoys and takes pride in the garden, but they don’t mention interacting with neighbors or other volunteers.

Guilds—local associations of artisans and merchants in the same industry—were widespread in France from the medieval period until the late eighteenth century. But guilds were much more numerous relative to the population in some cities than in others: for example, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. there were 49 guilds in Bordeaux but 72 guilds in Lyon despite the two cities having nearly equal numbers of inhabitants.  

B. Lyon had far fewer inhabitants than Paris did but had many more guilds.  C. there was one guild for every 661 inhabitants in Rouen but one guild for every 4,511 inhabitants in Paris.  D. Paris had 133 guilds and 600,000 inhabitants, or one guild for every 4,511 inhabitants.

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The claim we’re trying to prove is that guilds were much more numerous relative to population in some cities than others. This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and Paris), showing significant differences between guilds relative to population in these cities.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Bordeaux had 80,000 inhabitants, according to the table, while Lyon had 143,000, so it isn’t correct to say that they had "nearly equal numbers of inhabitants." Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Although Lyon did have fewer inhabitants than Paris, it didn’t have more guilds—Paris had 133 guilds versus Lyon’s 72. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. To show that guilds were more numerous relative to population in some cities than others, we would need to compare at least two cities, and this choice only mentions one.

Time Participants Spent Reading about Five London Museums 
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/32b97f20d3640a68d8022adb87a211472638b26ac0ae46e947a31169d14bc992.jpg)  

Researchers recently conducted an experiment to understand how we use rankings to make decisions. They created a fictitious travel website describing five museums in London. Then, they invited two groups of participants, who had never visited the museums, to review the site and select the museum they would be most likely to visit. Meanwhile, the researchers tracked the amount of time each participant spent reading about each museum. For one group, the website ranked each museum, titling the page “The Top 5 Museums in London.” For the other group, the museums and their descriptions were not ranked. The researchers concluded that when reviewing ranked lists, we tend to focus on the top-ranked option.  

Which choice best describes data in the table that support the researchers’ conclusion?  

A. Participants who were not provided with a ranking of the museums spent roughly equal amounts of time reading about each museum.  

B. Participants who were provided with a ranking of the museums spent disproportionately more time reading about the British museum.  

C. Participants who were provided with a ranking of the museums spent the least amount of time reading about the Natural History Museum.  

D. Participants who were not provided with a ranking of the museums spent the most time reading about the Victoria and Albert Museum.  
Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. By looking at the top-ranked option, we can see that people provided with ranked lists spent more time reading about the British Museum than reading about other museums (  $36\%$   of the time versus  $21\%$   for the second-ranked option).  

Choice A is incorrect. The claim is about people with ranked lists, and these data are about those with unranked lists. Choice C is incorrect. The claim is about people with ranked lists looking at the top-ranked option, and these data are about the third-ranked option. Choice D is incorrect. The claim is about people with ranked lists, and these data are about those with unranked lists.

Scientists have long believed that giraffes are mostly silent and communicate only visually with one another. But biologist Angela Stöger and her team analyzed hundreds of hours of recordings of giraffes in three European zoos and found that giraffes make a very low-pitched humming sound. The researchers claim that the giraffes use these sounds to communicate when it’s not possible for them to signal one another visually.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Stöger and her team’s claim?  

A. Giraffes have an excellent sense of vision and can see in color.  B. The giraffes only produced the humming sounds at night when they couldn’t see one another. C. Wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming sounds.   D. Researchers observed other animals in European zoos humming.

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes use humming to communicate when they cannot signal to one another visually. The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low-pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support Stöger and her team’s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound.  

Choice A is incorrect because finding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, Stöger and her team’s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because finding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could  
not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a finding that some other animals in zoos also hum.

Although many transposons, DNA sequences that move within an organism’s genome through shuffling or duplication, have become corrupted and inactive over time, those from the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) family appear to remain active in the genomes of some species. In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure that supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal known for its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the confirmation of a LINE transposon in Octopus vulgaris and Octopus bim acul o ides genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species’ capacity for advanced cognition.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ hypothesis?  

A. The LINE transposon in O. vulgaris and O. bim acul o ides genomes is active in an octopus brain structure that functions similarly to the human hippocampus. B. The human genome contains multiple transposons from the LINE family that are all primarily active in the hippocampus. C. A consistent number of copies of LINE transposons is present across the genomes of most octopus species, with few known corruptions. D. O. vulgaris and O. bim acul o ides have smaller brains than humans do relative to body size, but their genomes contain sequences from a wider variety of transposon families.  

# ID: 22e4d633 Answer  

Correct Answer: A Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The text says that LINE transposons are important in the human hippocampus, which supports complex cognition. If the LINE transposon found in octopuses is active in a similar part of their brain, that would suggest that LINE transposons support complex cognition in octopuses too, which in turn supports the hypothesis that LINE transposons are linked to advanced cognition in general.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how LINE transposons function in species other than humans. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how the LINE transposon in octopuses might support advanced cognition. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the hypothesis. It doesn’t include anything about how the LINE transposon in octopuses might support advanced cognition.

Characteristics of the Banks of the Provo River Downstream of the Jordanelle Dam  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/08c20d974b201cab46545347f2baec70faf227fb284a2d6ab22a1e31001edb72.jpg)  
The Jordanelle Dam was built on the Provo River in Utah in 1992. Earth scientist Adriana E. Martinez and colleagues tracked changes to the environment on the banks of the river downstream of the dam, including how much grass and forest cover were present. They concluded that the dam changed the flow of the river in ways that benefited grass plants but didn’t benefit trees.  

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion?  

A. The lowest amount of grass cover was approximately 58,000 square meters, and the highest amount of forest cover was approximately 75,000 square meters.  

B. There was more grass cover than forest cover in 1987, and this difference increased dramatically in 1993 and again in 2006.  

C. There was less grass cover than bare soil in 1987 but more grass cover than bare soil in 1993 and 2006, whereas there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years.  

D. Grass cover increased from 1987 to 1993 and from 1993 to 2006, whereas forest cover decreased in those periods.  
Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years— 1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees —grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.

To understand how expressions of anger in reviews of products affect readers of those reviews, business scholar Dezhi Yin and colleagues measured study participants’ responses to three versions of the same negative review— a control review expressing no anger, a review expressing a high degree of anger, and a review expressing a low degree of anger. Reviewing the data, a student concludes that the mere presence of anger in a review may not negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review, but a high degree of anger in a review does worsen readers’ perceptions of the review.  

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the students’ conclusion?  

A. On average, participants’ ratings of the helpfulness of the review were substantially higher than were participants’ ratings of the reviewed product regardless of which type of review participants had seen.  
B. Compared with participants who saw the control review, participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful, whereas participants who saw the high-anger review rated the review as less helpful.  

C. Participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful than participants who saw the control review did, but participants’ attitude toward the reviewed product was slightly worse when participants saw the low-anger review than when they saw the no-anger review.  

D. Compared with participants who saw the low-anger review, participants who saw the high-anger review rated the review as less helpful and had a less positive attitude toward the reviewed product.  

# ID: d5b9ed0d Answer  

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The claim is that low anger does not negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review, while high anger does negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review. This choice accurately expresses the supporting data from the “helpfulness of review” part of the graph: that low-anger reviews were rated as slightly more helpful than no-anger reviews, while high-anger reviews were rated as less helpful than no-anger reviews.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ ratings of the reviewed product are not relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ attitude towards the reviewed product is not relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support the conclusion. The conclusion is only about how participants feel about the review itself—the participants’ attitude towards the reviewed product is not relevant.

Sandra Cisneros’s 1984 novella The House on Mango Street made a lasting impact on US literature. Its depiction of Mexican American culture inspired later authors to examine their own heritage within their fictional works. Also influential was the book’s portrayal of the main character, Esperanza, during a pivotal year of her youth. This insightful depiction of a preteen girl encouraged authors who, like Cisneros herself, are Latina to use fictional works to examine experiences from their own youth.  

Which statement, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence?  

A. In interviews, a number of Latina authors say that The House on Mango Street inspired them to write about their own adolescence in their novels.  

B. In published writings, several prominent authors who are not Latina say that reading The House on Mango Street influenced their approach to writing fiction.  

C. The House on Mango Street has sold over six million copies and is one of the most commonly read books among high school and university students in the US.  

D. Since 1984, new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors have often been compared to The House on Mango Street.  

# ID: a13541c0 Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood.  

Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has  
influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella’s influence.

Seed Germination with and without  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}$   Treatment

In high concentrations, hydrogen sulfide   $(\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S})$   is typically toxic to many plants. Frederick D. Dooley and colleagues wanted to understand what effects low doses of  $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   might have on plant growth. They treated bean, corn, wheat, and pea seeds with various concentrations (measured in micromoles per liter) of   $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   and tracked the germination of those seeds along with the germination of untreated seeds. Treatment with particular concentrations of   $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   was associated with accelerated germination: for example, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?  

A. at 24 hours, less than   $10\%$   of seeds treated with  $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   at a concentration of 10 micromoles per liter had germinated, whereas more than  $90\%$   of those seeds had germinated at 168 hours.  

B. at 48 hours, more than  $70\%$   of seeds treated with  $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   at a concentration of 10 micromoles per liter had germinated, whereas only approximately   $50\%$   of untreated seeds had germinated.  

C. at 168 hours, more than  $90\%$   of seeds treated with  $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   at concentrations of 10 or 500 micromoles per liter had germinated, whereas less than  $70\%$   of untreated seeds had germinated.  

D. at 48 hours, approximately   $50\%$   of seeds treated with   $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{S}$   at a concentration of 10 micromoles per liter had germinated, whereas only approximately   $30\%$   of untreated seeds had germinated.  
Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The claim is that some concentrations of   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}$   led to increased germination rates, and this choice accurately shows that seeds treated with 10 micromoles per liter of H ₂ S tended to germinate faster than untreated seeds.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the claim. The claim compares the germination rates of seeds exposed to certain concentrations of  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}$   to untreated seeds, but this choice only discusses one concentration of  $\mathrm{H}_{\natural}\mathrm{S},$   so it can’t support any comparison between treated and untreated groups. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. At 168 hours, only about  $85\%$   of seeds treated with  $\mathrm{H}_{z}\mathrm{S}$   at 500 micromoles per liter and well over  $70\%$   of untreated seeds had germinated (about  $80\%$  ). Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. At 48 hours, about  $70\%$   of seeds treated with  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}$   at 10 micromoles per liter and about  $50\%$   of untreated seeds had germinated.

Rivers rich in sediment appear yellow, while increases in red algae make rivers appear red. To track things like the sediment or algae content of large US rivers, John R. Gardner and colleagues used satellite data to determine the dominant visible wavelengths of light measured for various segments of these rivers. The researchers classified wavelengths of 495 nanometers (nm) and below as red, wavelengths between 495 and   $560\;\mathsf{n m}$   as blue, and wavelengths of   $560\ \mathsf{n m}$   and above as yellow. The researchers concluded that for the Missouri River, segments flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than those flowing out of lakes.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?  

A. The segments of the Missouri River that had higher levels of chlorophyll-a, which contributes to the green color of photosynthetic organisms, have dominant wavelengths of light between 490 and 560 nm.  

B. In lakes through which segments of the Missouri River pass, the dominant wavelength of light tended to be above 560 nm near the lakes’ shores and below   $560\;\mathsf{n m}$   in the lakes’ centers.  

C. The majority of the segments of the Missouri River were found to have dominant wavelengths of light significantly higher than 560 nm.  

D. Segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes typically had dominant wavelengths of light above  $560\;\mathsf{n m}$  , while segments flowing out of lakes typically had dominant wavelengths below  $560\ \mathsf{n m}$  .  

# ID: dd72993d Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.  

Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers’ conclusion that  
segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes. Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers’ conclusion.

Plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and soybeans are susceptible to bacterial wilt disease caused by the bacteria Ralstonia solana ce arum. A multinational team of scientists led by Zhong Wei studied whether other microbes in the soil might influence the degree to which plants are affected by the disease. The team sampled soil surrounding individual tomato plants over time and compared the results of plants that became diseased with those that remained healthy. They concluded that the presence of certain microbes in the soil might explain the difference between healthy and diseased plants.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the team’s conclusion?  

A. The soil surrounding healthy plants contained significantly higher concentrations of microbes known to inhibit Ralstonia solana ce arum than the soil surrounding diseased plants did.  

B. The soil surrounding the plants contained high concentrations of Ralstonia solana ce arum regardless of whether the plants were affected by wilt disease.  

C. The soil surrounding healthy plants tended to have significantly higher moisture levels than the soil surrounding diseased plants did.  

D. By the end of the experiment, over half the plants had been affected by wilt disease regardless of differences in the types and concentrations of microbes in the surrounding soil.  

# ID: 67b59a67 Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This choice provides evidence that directly links the presence of  $R$  solana ce arum-inhibiting microbes in the soil to the health of tomato plants.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice would weaken the team’s conclusion. It suggests that the presence of the disease-causing bacteria had no effect on the health of the tomato plants. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the team’s conclusion. The conclusion is about microbes, not soil moisture. Choice D is incorrect. This choice would weaken the team’s conclusion. It suggests that the presence of the bacteriainhibiting microbe in soil had no effect on the health of the tomato plants.

Flint artifacts dating to 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago have been recovered from the Evron Quarry in Israel. Likely created by the hominin Homo erectus, the artifacts have no visual features suggesting that they were exposed to fire, leading some scholars to conclude that these hominins had not acquired control of fire. But Zane Stepka and colleagues recently used a new method to determine whether these artifacts had been exposed to temperatures above  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (the typical temperature campfires reach) and concluded that the hominins who inhabited the site may have had control of fire.  

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the team’s conclusion? A. Artifacts K5_106 and K3_9 were exposed to temperatures above   $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . B. Artifacts L5_239 and K3_18 were exposed to temperatures of approximately   $550\mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$   and  $650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\prime}$   respectively. C. All of the artifacts were exposed to temperatures above   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . D. Artifact K3_9 was exposed to a higher temperature than was artifact K5_106.  

# ID: 7edfb2c5 Answer  

Correct Answer: B Rationale  
Choice B is the best answer. Campfires typically reach over  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   so human artifacts that were exposed to temperatures higher than this may indicate some human control over fire.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. Neither artifact K3_9 nor K5_106 was exposed to temperatures above even   $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Campfires typically reach over  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , so exposure to temperatures of  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   wouldn’t demonstrate exposure to fire. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Both artifacts K3_9 and K5_106 were exposed to temperatures of less than  $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Since campfires typically reach over  $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   this wouldn’t demonstrate exposure to fire.

Although it’s clear that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, astronomers have debated whether the evidence of ancient water reflects a prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions—the so-called wet and warm scenario—or a brief period of melting in an otherwise consistently frozen environment. Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere. Cardenas and Lamb concluded that the wet and warm scenario is likely correct.  

Which finding about the basin, if true, would most directly support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion?  

A. Its dimensions and shape indicate that it is unlikely to have formed as the result of an asteroid or comet impact.  

B. It has features suggesting that it once held an ocean that underwent gradual sea-level changes over an extended time.  

C. Its physical characteristics are most consistent with it having formed as a result of a massive but short-lived influx of liquid water.  

D. It is surrounded by channels that could have been formed either by running water or by flowing lava.  

# ID: 0c622cfb Answer  

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers’ conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for "an extended time," that supports the "wet and warm scenario" on Mars, which involved a "prolonged" period of temperate conditions (and not just a "brief period of melting").  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was filled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the "wet and warm" theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers’ conclusions, but rather the opposite. A "massive but short lived influx" of liquid water is not the same as a "prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions." It more reflects the opposing theory, a "brief period of melting." Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars ("wet and warm" and "brief period of melting") involve flowing water, but lava isn’t mentioned at all in the text. Therefore, this choice doesn’t provide exclusive support for either theory.

The Land of Enchantment is a 1906 travel book by Lilian Whiting. In the book, which describes the experience of traveling through the southwestern United States by train, Whiting reflects on the escape from everyday life that such a journey provides: ______  

Which quotation from The Land of Enchantment most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “The opportunities and advantages already offered and constantly increasing are greater than would at first be considered possible.” B. “The social and the picturesque charm of the long journey is singularly enhanced by the leisurely stops made for refreshment.”  C. “The real journey begins, of course, at Chicago, and as these trains leave in the evening the traveller fares forth in the seclusion of his berth.”  

D. “One experiences a certain sense of detachment from ordinary day and daylight duties that is exhilarating.”  

# ID: 5fb6ed10 Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because. This quotation specifically describes a "sense of detachment from ordinary day," which matches the claim’s focus on "escape from everyday life."  

Choice A is incorrect. While this quotation describes new opportunities associated with Whiting’s experience, it doesn’t frame these opportunities as "an escape," and it doesn’t directly compare Whiting’s journey with "everyday life." Choice B is incorrect. While this quotation includes a positive characterization of Whiting’s journey, it doesn’t specifically address the idea of an "escape from everyday life," which is the focus of the claim. Choice C is incorrect. This quotation focuses on where the journey begins, not on how it feels like an "escape from everyday life."

Sense and Sensibility is an 1811 novel by Jane Austen. In the novel, Austen describes Marianne Dashwood’s ability to persuade others of the rightness of her artistic judgments, as is evident when Marianne visits with John Willoughby, a potential suitor: ______  

Which quotation from Sense and Sensibility most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “Above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.”  

B. “Their taste was strikingly alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by each—or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.”  

C. “It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.”  

D. “They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books.”  

# ID: c538954d Answer  

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. By showing that "any difference" in taste was quickly overcome by "the force of [Marianne’s] arguments," this choice effectively demonstrates Marianne’s "ability to persuade others."  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t effectively illustrate the claim. This choice shows that Marianne and John share an interest in music and dancing, but it doesn’t provide evidence of Marianne’s "ability to persuade others." Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t effectively illustrate the claim. This choice shows that Marianne enjoys talking about her interests, but it doesn’t provide evidence of Marianne’s "ability to persuade others." Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t effectively illustrate the claim. This choice shows that Marianne and John share many interests and generally agree on music and dancing, but it doesn’t provide evidence of Marianne’s "ability to persuade others."

Monthly Hours of Sunshine from April to September in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/30afec1499b98f3e4def422a127ccc8d77c84f3ab615996ec37dc5ed15dd124e.jpg)  
A student is researching monthly hours of sunshine in different cities in Alaska. When comparing trends in Anchorage and Fairbanks, the student concludes that the two cities show a similar pattern in the monthly hours of sunshine from April to September.  

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion?  

A. The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks hold steady in June and July before beginning to decline in August.  

B. The monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks increase from April to June and then decrease from June to September.  

C. Anchorage and Fairbanks both have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine from April to September.  

D. Anchorage and Fairbanks both have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June and less than 200 hours from July to September.  
Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student’s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September.  

Choice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don’t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn’t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September.

B. “The grey Prince Albert was scrupulously buttoned about his form, and a shiny top hat replaced the felt of the afternoon.”  

C. “It was a beautiful day in balmy May and the sun shone pleasantly on Mr. Cornelius Johnson’s very spruce Prince Albert suit of grey as he alighted from the train in Washington.”  

D. “Mr. Cornelius Johnson always spoke in a large and important tone.”

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This quote most effectively illustrates the claim. The claim is that the narrator describes Mr. Johnson as arrogant and self-important. This basically says that Mr. Johnson always looks like he’s congratulating himself for something, which definitely supports the idea that Mr. Johnson is arrogant! .  

Choice B is incorrect. This quote doesn’t illustrate the claim. The claim is that the narrator describes Mr. Johnson’s appearance as conveying his arrogance. This describes his appearance, but the description doesn’t suggest a sense of arrogance. Choice C is incorrect. This quote doesn’t illustrate the claim. The claim is that the narrator describes Mr. Johnson’s appearance as conveying his arrogance. This doesn’t describe Mr. Johnson’s appearance very much, and it doesn’t suggest a sense of arrogance. Choice D is incorrect. This quote doesn’t effectively illustrate the claim. It describes Mr. Johnson’s tone of voice as “large and important,” but it doesn’t describe his appearance as conveying a sense of self-importance.

Average Nitrate and Phosphate Concentrations in Seawater after Volcanic Eruption  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8362dfaad046724829d8d39b1cf840170f197c9f3266cb3d4010ec7e33a7b079.jpg)  

After a volcanic eruption spilled lava into North Pacific Ocean waters, a dramatic increase of diatoms (a kind of phytoplankton) near the surface occurred. Scientists assumed the diatoms were thriving on nutrients such as phosphate from the lava, but analysis showed these nutrients weren’t present near the surface in forms diatoms can consume. However, there was an abundance of usable nitrate, a nutrient usually found in much deeper water and almost never found in lava. Microbial oceanographer Sonya Dyhrman and colleagues believe that as the lava plunged nearly 300 meters below the surface it dislodged pockets of this nutrient, releasing it to float upward, given that ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. at 5–45 meters below the surface, the average concentration of phosphate was about the same in the seawater in the lava-affected area as in the seawater outside of the lava-affected area.  

B. for both depth ranges measured, the average concentrations of nitrate were substantially higher in the seawater in the lava-affected area than in the seawater outside of the lava-affected area.  

C. for both depth ranges measured in the seawater in the lava-affected area, the average concentrations of nitrate were substantially higher than the average concentrations of phosphate.  

D. in the seawater outside of the lava-affected area, there was little change in the average concentration of nitrate from 75–125 meters below the surface to 5–45 meters below the surface.  
Choice B is the best answer. The claim is that the lava freed the deep nitrate, allowing it to float upward. The table supports this by showing that there was more nitrate in the lava-affected seawater at various depths above 300 meters (the depth to which the lava plunged) than in unaffected seawater.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the statement in a way that supports the claim. The claim is about nitrate, not phosphate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the statement in a way that supports the claim. The claim is only about nitrate—the concentrations of phosphate aren’t relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the statement in a way that supports the claim. It doesn’t say anything about the seawater inside the lava-affected area.

The share of the world’s population living in cities has increased dramatically since 1970, but this change has not been uniform. France and Japan, for example, were already heavily urbanized in 1970, with  $70\%$   or more of the population living in cities. The main contributors to the world’s urbanization since 1970 have been countries like Algeria, whose population went from ______

Matthew D. Rocklage and team examined whether consumer ratings of movies can predict box office success. The team considered both numeric star ratings and written reviews in their research. To analyze the written reviews, the team measured the emotional it y—the degree to which a written review expresses an emotional reaction—of user reviews on a movie rating website, assigning each review an emotional it y score. After reviewing this research, a student argues that the emotional it y of movie reviews is unrelated to a movie’s success at the box office.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the student’s conclusion?  

A. Movies that had the highest average emotional it y scores received the lowest average star ratings on the movie rating website.  

B. The average emotional it y score of a movie’s reviews was a positive predictor of that movie’s box office earnings.  

C. More than half of the movies that the team examined received an average star rating of 3 out of 5 stars. D. The movies that were most successful at the box office tended to have high average star ratings.

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This choice weakens the student’s conclusion by suggesting that the emotional it y of movie reviews is related to box office success: the higher the emotional it y score, the better the movie performs at the box office.  

Choice A is incorrect. While this choice does mention emotional it y scores, it only connects them to star ratings, not to box office success. Choice C is incorrect. The fact that many movies received an average star rating doesn’t tell us anything about the relationship between emotional it y and box office success. Choice D is incorrect. While this choice suggests that star ratings can predict box office success, it doesn’t address the issue of emotional it y in written reviews, which is the focus of the student’s conclusion.

Which quotation from   $"\textdegree_{\textmd{on}}$   Virtue” most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “Attend me, Virtue, thro’ my youthful years! / O leave me not to the false joys of time! / But guide my steps to endless life and bliss.”  

B. “I cease to wonder, and no more attempt / Thine height t’explore, or fathom thy profound.”

D. “But, O my soul, sink not into despair, / Virtue is near thee, and with gentle hand  $/$   Would now embrace thee, hovers o’er thine head.”  

# ID: 25290c8d Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Wheatley addresses her poem "On Virtue" to the quality of virtue, imploring it to assist her in reaching a future goal. In the quotation, Wheatley begs virtue to accompany her, or "attend [her]," through her youth and to "guide [her] steps to" the future goal of "endless life and bliss."  

Choice B is incorrect because this quotation suggests the difficulty of fully comprehending virtue. Rather than asking virtue for help, Wheatley presents it as a quality that is impossible to entirely understand because it is so grand and deep. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation describes Wheatley’s effort to comprehend virtue despite virtue itself declaring that such wisdom is beyond her grasp, or "higher than a fool can reach." Choice D is incorrect because rather than asking virtue for help in this quotation, Wheatley urges herself to "sink not into despair" because virtue is always nearby.

Some whale species practice lunge feeding, in which they lunge toward prey with their mouths open at wide angles, collect the prey and the surrounding water, and then filter out the water through baleen plates in their mouths. Although the volume of water engulfed increases with whales’ body length, the surface area of whales’ baleen plates, which influences the rate at which water can be filtered, does not increase with body length to the same degree, which helps explain why ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. minke whales and humpback whales show similar average filter times. B. humpback whales show an average of 6.28 lunges per dive. C. fin whales show a longer average filter time than minke whales do.  

D. blue whales show the longest average filter time and the highest average number of lunges per dive.

Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. To support the claim, we need to show that longer whales take more time to filter all the water they engulf than shorter whales do. This choice accurately reflects that a longer whale (the fin whale) takes more time to filter engulfed water (31.30 seconds on average) compared to a shorter whale (the minke whale, which only took 8.88 seconds on average).  

Choice A is incorrect. The table shows that minke whales take an average of 8.88 seconds to filter engulfed water, while humpback whales take an average of 17.12 seconds to complete the same task. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t reflect the claim about baleen plates. The claim explains why whales of differing lengths take different amounts of time to filter engulfed water. This choice doesn’t compare whales of different lengths, and it focuses on the number of lunges, which isn’t shown to be relevant to filter time. Choice D is  
incorrect. The table shows that blue whales average 4.02 lunges per dive, which is not the highest average among the whales in the table.

A. the four groups of mice differed greatly in their activity levels before treatment but showed identical activity levels at the end of the monitoring period.  

B. saline-treated females showed substantially more activity at certain points in the monitoring period than saline-treated males did.  

C. CNO-treated females showed more activity relative to saline-treated females than CNO-treated males showed relative to saline-treated males.  
D. CNO-treated females showed a substantial increase and then decline in activity over the monitoring period, whereas CNO-treated males showed a substantial decline in activity followed by a steep increase.  

# ID: e2829dd7 Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The graph shows that the CNO-treated females were way more active than the CNO-treated males, while the saline-treated males and females (the control groups) had very similar activity levels. This supports the claim that there were sex-specific differences in the mice’s response to neuron activation.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. All four groups of mice started at nearly the same activity level before treatment (see how all four points are very close together at -4 minutes, meaning four minutes before treatment). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t complete the assertion. The assertion is about the mice’s response to neuron activation, so we need to include the data about the CNO-treated females and males. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The line for the CNO-treated males does not show a “substantial decline” until around 122 minutes, and there is no “steep increase” afterward.

“Odalie” is an 1899 short story by Alice Dunbar-Nelson. In the story, a young woman named Odalie attends the annual Mardi Gras carnival in New Orleans, where she lives with her guardian Tante Louise. Dunbar-Nelson portrays Odalie as eager to escape the monotony of her everyday life: ______  

Which quotation from “Odalie” most effectively illustrates the claim? A. “Mardi Gras was a tiresome day, after all, she sighed, and Tante Louise agreed with her for once.”  

B. “In the old French house on Royal Street, with its quaint windows and Spanish courtyard green and cool, and made musical by the plashing of the fountain and the trill of caged birds, lived Odalie in convent-like seclusion.”  

C. “When one is shut up in a great French house with a grim sleepy tante and no companions of one’s own age, life becomes a dull thing, and one is ready for any new sensation.”  

D. “It was Mardi Gras day at last, and early through her window Odalie could hear the jingle of folly bells on the [participants’] costumes, the tinkle of music, and the echoing strains of songs.”  

# ID: c6b470bb Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from “Odalie” to illustrate the claim that Odalie is eager to escape the monotony, or tedious lack of variety, of her everyday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling “shut up” and complains that she has “no companions” except for her “sleepy tante.” Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is “dull” and she is “ready for any new sensation,” meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word “tiresome,” which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie’s negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has “quaint windows” and a “green and cool” courtyard that is “made musical” by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes the lively sounds of a Mardi Gras celebration that Odalie hears through her window, not the monotony of Odalie’s everyday life or her wish to escape.

Jan Gimsa, Robert Sleigh, and Ulrike Gimsa have hypothesized that the sail-like structure running down the back of the dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making quick, evasive movements. To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of researchers constructed two battery-powered mechanical models of S. aegyptiacus, one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models to a series of identical tests in a water-filled tank.  

Which finding from the model tests, if true, would most strongly support Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis?  

A. The model with a sail took significantly less time to complete a sharp turn while submerged than the model without a sail did.  

B. The model with a sail displaced significantly more water while submerged than the model without a sail did.  

C. The model with a sail had significantly less battery power remaining after completing the tests than the model without a sail did.  

D. The model with a sail took significantly longer to travel a specified distance while submerged than the model without a sail did.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This finding would most strongly support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. This finding suggests that the sail helped the dinosaur make sharp turns more quickly, which supports that hypothesis.  

Choice B is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the sail displacing more water would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the difference in battery power between the models would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice D is incorrect. This finding would actually weaken the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. This finding suggests that the sail slowed the dinosaur down—which would probably make it worse at catching quick, evasive prey.

Rotor Diameters of Newly Installed Wind Turbines in the United States, 2011–2021  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/facab830f8b8f480dc87792d26b4529a598cd47eb52f2d2ff37eff8ce7e47b6d.jpg)  
All other things being equal, the larger a wind turbine’s rotor diameter (the diameter of the imaginary circle swept by the turbine’s rotating blades), the greater amount of energy the turbine can generate. In a research paper on wind power, a student claims that in the United States, the amount of energy generated per newly installed turbine increased substantially between 2011 and 2021.  

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the student’s claim?  

A. The percentage of newly installed turbines with rotor diameters greater than 130 meters increased every year between 2011 and 2021.  

B. In 2011, nearly  $80\%$   of turbines installed had rotor diameters of less than 100 meters, whereas only a little more than  $20\%$   of turbines installed that year had rotor diameters of 100–115 meters.  

C. No turbines installed in 2011 had rotor diameters greater than 115 meters, whereas the majority of turbines installed in 2021 had rotor diameters greater than 130 meters.  

D. Most turbines installed in 2011 had rotor diameters of less than 100 meters, whereas most turbines installed in 2021 had rotor diameters of at least 115 meters.  
Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that turbines with larger rotor diameters produce more energy, so if rotor diameters have generally gotten larger between 2011 and 2021, then turbines created in 2021 should produce more energy than those created in 2011.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The percentage of newly installed turbines with rotor diameters greater than 130 meters didn’t show any visible increase until 2018. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the claim. The claim is about increasing energy output from 2011 to 2021, but this choice only discusses 2011, so it can’t show evidence of change over time. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. In 2021, only about  $25\%$   of turbines installed in 2021 had rotor diameters greater than 130 meters.

Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Héctor Tobar has built a multifaceted career as both a journalist and an author of short stories and novels. In an essay about Tobar’s work, a student claims that Tobar blends his areas of expertise by applying journalism techniques to his creation of works of fiction.  

Which quotation from a literary critic best supports the student’s claim?  

A. “For one novel, an imagined account of a real person’s global travels, Tobar approached his subject like a reporter, interviewing people the man had met along the way and researching the man’s own writings.”  

B. “Tobar got his start as a volunteer for   $E I$   Tecolote, a community newspaper in San Francisco, and wrote for newspapers for years before earning a degree in creative writing and starting to publish works of fiction.”  

C. “Many of Tobar’s notable nonfiction articles are marked by the writer’s use of techniques usually associated with fiction, such as complex narrative structures and the incorporation of symbolism.”  

D. “The protagonist of Tobar’s third novel is a man who wants to be a novelist and keeps notes about interesting people he encounters so he can use them when developing characters for his stories.”  

# ID: 1d08c7ee Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The example of Tobar approaching his subject “like a reporter,” including conducting “interviews” and “research,” shows Tobar applying journalism techniques to his fiction-writing.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It tells us about Tobar’s initial career as a journalist, but it doesn’t say anything about him “applying journalism techniques” to his fiction-writing. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It tells us that Tobar applied fiction techniques to his nonfiction writing, but we’re looking for evidence of the other way around: that Tobar applied journalism techniques to his fiction-writing. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. It tells us that a character in one of Tobar’s novels applied a journalism technique to his fiction-writing, but it doesn’t tell us that Tobar did that himself.

Rows in table may not add up to 100 due to rounding. Georgia Tech robotic is ts De’Aira Bryant and Ayanna Howard, along with ethicist Jason Borenstein, were interested in people’s perceptions of robots’ competence. They recruited participants and asked them how likely they think it is that a robot could do the work required in various occupations. Participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on which occupation was being considered; for example, ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example?  

A.  $47\%$   of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a teacher, but  $37\%$   of respondents believe that it is somewhat or very unlikely that a robot could do so.  

B.  $9\%$   of participants were neutral about whether a robot could work effectively as a television news anchor, which is the same percent of participants who were neutral when asked about a robot working as a surgeon.  

C.  $82\%$   of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a tour guide, but only  $16\%$   believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work as a surgeon.  

D.  $62\%$   of participants believe that it is somewhat or very unlikely that a robot could work effectively as a firefighter.

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the table to complete the example of variations in participants’ evaluations. The table shows participants’ evaluations of the likelihood that robots could work effectively in different occupations. The text asserts that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on the occupation being considered and introduces an example supporting that assertion. The data from the table showing that  $82\%$   of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a tour guide but only  $16\%$   of participants believe that it is somewhat or very likely that a robot could work effectively as a surgeon illustrate this assertion: those data show participants’ views changing substantially with the occupation being considered.  
Choice A is incorrect because it does not describe data that illustrate the assertion that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on which occupation was being considered. Although this choice accurately describes data in the table, data about participants’ responses when considering a single occupation—teaching—could not be an example of people’s views changing substantially depending on the occupation being considered. Choice B is incorrect because it identifies a similarity in participants’ responses when considering two different occupations, but the assertion that the example is intended to illustrate is that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on the occupation being considered. Although this choice accurately describes data in the table, those data do not illustrate the assertion in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it does not describe data that illustrate the assertion that participants’ evaluations varied widely depending on which occupation was being considered. Although this choice accurately describes data in the table, data showing participants’ evaluation of just one occupation could not be an example of participants’ evaluations changing depending on the occupation under evaluation.

To test the effects of a nitrogen fertilizer on cantaloupe production, researchers grew cantaloupe plants and harvested their fruit over three years. In each year, half the plants were grown using a nitrogen fertilizer, and the other half were grown using a control fertilizer that contained no nitrogen. The researchers concluded that the nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.  

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion?  

A. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a yield of at least 30 pounds per acre.  

B. In every year of the experiment, plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer had a greater yield than did plants treated with the control fertilizer.  

C. The 2018 yield for plants treated with the control fertilizer was greater than was the 2019 yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer.  

D. The yield for plants treated with the nitrogen fertilizer increased from 2017 to 2018.  

# ID: 1db1a9a6 Answer  

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for  
plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017–2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the controlgroup yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.  

Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph—in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre—a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers’ conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.

An Ideal Husband is an 1895 play by Oscar Wilde. In the play, which is a satire, Wilde suggests that a character named Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as both extremely virtuous and unforgiving, as is evident when another character says ______  

Which quotation from An Ideal Husband most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles, I am glad to say. I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who do.” B. “Do you know, [Lady Chiltern], I don’t mind your talking morality a bit. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.” C. “[Lady Chiltern] does not know what weakness or temptation is. I am of clay like other men. She stands apart as good women do—pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.”  

D. “Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.”  

# ID: 16a4a83b Answer  

Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation to illustrate the claim that Lady Gertrude Chiltern is perceived as “both extremely virtuous and unforgiving.” In the quotation, a man describes Lady Chiltern as someone who “does not know what weakness or temptation is.” In other words, the man regards her as someone who is strong and adheres to a strict definition of moral perfection. However, he ironically suggests that this definition excludes mercy and forgiveness—qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is “pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.” This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving.  

Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as “a woman of the very highest principles.” However, it doesn’t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn’t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t address either Lady Chiltern’s perceived virtuousness or her perceived lack of forgiveness; instead, it expresses the belief that she is sensible.

In a survey of public perceptions of energy use, researcher Shahzeen Attari and her team asked respondents to name the most effective action ordinary people can take to conserve energy. The team categorized each action as either an efficiency or a curtailment and found that respondents tended to name curtailments more often than they did efficiencies. For example,  $19.6\%$   of respondents stated that the most effective way to conserve energy is to turn off the lights, while only ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the text?  

A.  $6.3\%$   of respondents said it was most effective to use efficient cars or hybrids. B.  $2.8\%$   of respondents said it was most effective to change the thermostat setting. C.  $12.9\%$   of respondents said it was most effective to use a bike or public transportation.

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the text’s discussion of Attari and her team’s survey results. The text states that the team asked respondents to identify the most effective action people can take to save energy, with the team classifying each action as either an efficiency or a curtailment. According to the text, respondents named curtailments more often than they did efficiencies. The text then offers an example that begins by citing a curtailment, turning off the lights, that was selected by a relatively high percentage of respondents   $(19.6\%)$  ). Given that the example is presented in support of the idea that more respondents selected curtailments than efficiencies, the most effective way to complete  
the example is by citing an efficiency, using efficient light bulbs, that was selected by a relatively low percentage of respondents (only  $3.6\%$  ).  

Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data in the table. The data indicate that  $6.3\%$   of respondents said the most effective action was to change the thermostat setting, not to use efficient cars or hybrids. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data in the table. The data indicate that   $2.8\%$   of respondents said the most effective action was to use efficient cars/hybrids, not to change the thermostat setting. Choice C is incorrect because it mentions a curtailment (using a bike or public transportation) and not an efficiency. The text states that a research team asked respondents to identify the most effective action people can take to save energy, with the team classifying each action as either an efficiency or a curtailment. According to the text, respondents named curtailments more often than they did efficiencies. The text then offers an example that begins by citing a curtailment, turning off the lights, that was selected by a relatively high percentage of respondents   $(19.6\%)$  . Given that the example is presented in support of the idea that more people selected curtailments than efficiencies, the most effective way to complete the example is not by referring to another curtailment but rather by referring to an efficiency that was selected by a relatively low percentage of respondents.

Gabrielle Adams and colleagues reviewed suggestions for improving a university that had been submitted to the university’s president. They coded each suggestion as additive (the idea suggested adding something new to the university), subtractive (the idea suggested removing something from the university), neither additive nor subtractive, or invalid (the idea was not comprehensible). The data illustrated people’s tendency to overlook the possibility of removing things to achieve improvements: ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data in the graph to complete the statement?  

A. around 175 suggestions were coded as neither additive nor subtractive, whereas around 575 suggestions were coded as additive.  

B. more than 350 suggestions were coded as invalid, whereas fewer than 100 suggestions were coded as subtractive.  
C. fewer than 100 suggestions were coded as subtractive, whereas more than 550 suggestions were coded as additive.  

D. around 575 suggestions were coded as additive, whereas around 175 suggestions were coded as subtractive.  

# ID: 23e2421a Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. This choice shows that people suggested removing things to achieve improvements a lot less often than they suggested adding things, which supports the claim that people tend not to think of removing things as a likely way to improve the university.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. We are looking to prove that people suggested subtractive means of achieving improvements less often than other means, but this choice doesn’t address how often people made subtractive suggestions. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Invalid responses were incomprehensible, so we can’t compare what they were suggesting to what was being suggested in subtractive responses. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. Fewer than 100 suggestions were coded as subtractive. 175 is the approximate number of suggestions coded as “neither additive or subtractive.”

In 1967 the US Congress created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created National Public Radio (NPR). NPR began producing and distributing high-quality news and cultural programming to affiliate stations across the United States in 1971. In a research paper, a student claims that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the British Broadcasting System (BBC), which had been established in the 1920s.  

Which quotation from a work by a historian would be the most effective evidence for the student to include in support of this claim?  

A. “Although the BBC had begun as a private corporation, politicians successfully argued to make it a public company because they believed a public broadcaster could help build national unity in the aftermath of World War I.”  

B. “For many decades, the BBC had no competition since it held Britain’s only broadcasting license, whereas in the United States, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting launched NPR in a broadcasting market already filled with competitors.”  

C. “Congress’s embrace of publicly funded broadcasting reflected a common belief among US politicians that the role of government was not only to ensure people’s safety and liberty but also to enrich people’s lives in other ways.”  

D. “The goal of the BBC was to support British democracy by promoting an informed citizenry, and US legislators believed that ensuring access to high-quality programming could do the same for democracy in the United States.”  

# ID: b4cda84d Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because this quotation would be the most effective evidence to include in support of the claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the British Broadcasting System (BBC). The quotation states that the goal of the BBC was to support British democracy and that US legislators believed high-quality programming could accomplish the same goal for democracy in the United States. In other words, US legislators looked to the BBC as a model, taking direct inspiration from it when they created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR.  

Choice A is incorrect because this quotation provides historical information about the BBC, not information about the inspiration for the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR. This quotation, therefore, is irrelevant to the student’s claim that the BBC inspired the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation contrasts the lack of competition faced by the BBC with the substantial competition faced by NPR, which has no bearing on the  
student’s claim that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR were inspired by the BBC. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation focuses on a common belief among US politicians that inspired Congress’s embrace of publicly funded broadcasting. The quotation doesn’t say anything about the BBC and therefore doesn’t support the claim that the BBC inspired Congress to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn created NPR.

In the 1970s, a roughly 60,000-year-old piece of hyena bone marked with nine notches was discovered at a site in western France once inhabited by Neanderthals. Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim? A. Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.  

B. More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a site in western France.  

C. It would have taken careful effort to make evenly spaced lines on bone with the stone tools typically used by Neanderthals.  

D. Decorative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on "decorative art" at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that it took effort to make the lines doesn’t tell us anything about what the lines were for.

“Ghosts of the Old Year” is an early 1900s poem by James Weldon Johnson. In the poem, the speaker describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection: ______  

Which quotation from “Ghosts of the Old Year” most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “What does this brazen tongue declare, / That falling on the midnight air / Brings to my heart a sense of care / Akin to fright?” B. “The snow has ceased its fluttering flight, / The wind sunk to a whisper light, / An ominous stillness fills the night, / A pause—a hush.” C. “It tells of many a squandered day, / Of slighted gems and treasured clay, / Of precious stores not laid away, / Of fields unreaped.”  

D. “And so the years go swiftly by, / Each, coming, brings ambitions high, / And each, departing, leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.”  

# ID: 87023f34 Answer  

Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it presents the quotation that most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker of the poem describes experiencing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection.  

Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does  
convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret. Instead, the speaker is simply lamenting wasted time and opportunities.

# Municipalities’ Responses to Inquiries about Potential Incentives for Firm  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5b6727891ba6d9ba750a49628c646a33f6d23a80e3b86e5d78bb5e0fc7b2e6b6.jpg)  

In the United States, firms often seek incentives from municipal governments to expand to those municipalities. A team of political scientists hypothesized that municipalities are much more likely to respond to firms and offer incentives if expansions can be announced in time to benefit local elected officials than if they can’t. The team contacted officials in thousands of municipalities, inquiring about incentives for a firm looking to expand and indicating that the firm would announce its expansion on a date either just before or just after the next election.  

Which choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the team’s hypothesis?  

A. A large majority of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement before the next election didn’t respond to the inquiry.  

B. The proportion of municipalities that responded to the inquiry or offered incentives didn’t substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.  
C. Only around half the municipalities that responded to inquiries mentioning plans for an announcement before the next election offered incentives.  

D. Of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement date after the next election, more than 1,200 didn’t respond and only around 100 offered incentives.  

# ID: a15b3219 Answer  

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The lighter bars show what happened when the announcement was to come before the election, and the darker bars show what happened when the announcement was to come after the election. For all three of the outcomes, the light and dark bars are virtually the same, demonstrating that the announcement timing didn’t actually make a difference.  

Choice A is incorrect. This accurately describes some data from the graph, but it doesn’t weaken the hypothesis. It doesn’t include the “announcement after election” data for comparison. Choice C is incorrect. This accurately describes some data from the graph, but it doesn’t weaken the hypothesis. It doesn’t include the “announcement after election” data for comparison. Choice D is incorrect. This accurately describes some data from the graph, but it doesn’t weaken the hypothesis. It doesn’t include the “announcement before election” data for comparison.

Employing high-performance liquid chromatography—a process that uses pressurized water to separate material into its component molecules—astro chemist Yashiro Oba and colleagues analyzed two samples of the Murchison meteorite that landed in Australia as well as soil from the landing zone of the meteorite to determine the concentrations of various organic molecules. By comparing the relative concentrations of types of molecules known as nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite with those in the soil, the team concluded that there is evidence that the nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite formed in space and are not the result of contamination on Earth.  

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the team’s conclusion? A. Isoguanine and purine were detected in both meteorite samples but not in the soil sample. B. Adenine and xanthine were detected in both of the meteorite samples and in the soil sample. C. Hypo xanthine and purine were detected in both the Murchison meteorite sample 2 and in the soil sample. D. Isoguanine and hypo xanthine were detected in the Murchison meteorite sample 1 but not in sample 2.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination. Presence of nucleobases in the meteorite and not in soil provides evidence that those nucleobases likely didn’t come from the soil.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t justify the conclusion. The researchers concluded that the meteorite’s nucleobases weren’t the result of soil contamination. If the nucleobases are present in both the soil and meteorite, then it’s possible that these nucleobases came from the soil. Choice C is incorrect. This choice  
misreads the table. Purine was not detected in the soil sample. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Both isoguanine and hypo xanthine were detected in both Murchison meteorite samples.

In 1534 CE, King Henry VIII of England split with the Catholic Church and declared himself head of the Church of England, in part because Pope Clement VII refused to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Two years later, Henry VIII introduced a policy titled the Dissolution of the Monasteries that by 1540 had resulted in the closure of all Catholic monasteries in England and the confiscation of their estates. Some historians assert that the enactment of the policy was primarily motivated by perceived financial opportunities.  

Which quotation from a scholarly article best supports the assertion of the historians mentioned in the text?  

A. “At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about 2 percent of the adult male population of England were monks; by 1690, the proportion of the adult male population who were monks was less than 1 percent.”  

B. “A contemporary description of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Michael Sherbrook’s Falle of the Religious Howses, recounts witness testimony that monks were allowed to keep the contents of their cells and that the monastery timber was purchased by local yeomen.”  

C. “In 1535, the year before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry commissioned a survey of the value of church holdings in England—the work, performed by sheriffs, bishops, and magistrates, began that January and was swiftly completed by the summer.”  

D. “The October 1536 revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace had several economic motives: high food prices due to a poor harvest the prior year; the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which closed reliable sources of food and shelter for many; and rents and taxes throughout Northern England that were not merely high but predatory.”

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. The fact that Henry VIII commissioned a survey of church holdings just before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was interested in the potential profits from claiming their assets. This supports the historians’ assertion.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice describes a potential effect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The decrease in the proportion of monks in England isn’t relevant to the question of Henry VIII’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. Details about how the monks were treated during the dissolution don’t address Henry VIII’s motivations for enacting the policy in the first place. That the monks could keep the content of their cells (their rooms) and sell off the timber they’d harvested has no impact on the value of the monasteries’ estates— their land holdings. Choice D is incorrect. This choice mentions one impact that the Dissolution of the Monasteries contributed to, two years after it happened. But it doesn’t help explain why Henry VIII might have wanted to enact the policy in the first place.

Fur Seal REM Sleep on Land after an Extended Period in Water  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c73d272e4ff4ccdcc1790f5ec8c0bddf82e6cd11fe9e85498fda4d53ddef2eee.jpg)  
Research suggests that REM sleep in animals is homeostatic ally regulated: animals compensate for periods of REM sleep deprivation by increasing subsequent REM sleep. When on land, fur seals get enough REM sleep, but during the weeks they’re in the water, they get almost none. In a study of fur seals’ sleep habits, researchers recorded the REM sleep (as a percentage of baseline) of fur seals once they had returned to land. They concluded that REM sleep may not be homeostatic ally regulated in fur seals, citing as evidence the fact that the seals in the study ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?  

A. didn’t show significantly less REM sleep during the second day after returning to land than they did during the first day.  

B. showed no significant differences from one another in baseline levels of REM sleep.  

C. didn’t consistently demonstrate a significant increase in REM sleep after their period of deprivation in the water.  

D. showed no significant difference between REM sleep after returning to land and REM sleep while in the water.  
Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. If REM sleep were homeostatic ally regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We’d also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatic ally.  

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatic ally regulated in fur seals, then we’d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of REM deprivation while in the water. Whether or not there’s a reduction in REM sleep from day 1 to day 2 doesn’t tell us how REM sleep on those days relates to baseline, which is where our focus should be. Choice B is incorrect. The y-axis of this graph doesn’t depict baseline levels of REM sleep, but rather shows REM sleep as a percent of baseline. Choice D is incorrect. The graph doesn’t depict REM sleep while in the water for the seals in the study. Additionally, we’re told fur seals get no REM sleep while in the water, which is significantly different to the values shown in the graph for after they return to land.

Home Heating Needs Met with Subsurface Thermal Pollution for Two Temperature Conditions, by Percentage of Sites  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/d44733e82a72561128ce5ce92931377d07577f708a1a3a59ba32f79cfbd5ef5c.jpg)  

Urbanization, industrialization, and the warming climate create thermal pollution (excess heat) in the shallow subsurface soil. Susanne A. Benz and colleagues analyzed thousands of sites on three continents under one scenario in which surface temperature remains at the current level and under another in which the surface reaches the maximum plausible temperature. They then categorized each site according to the percentage of local home heating needs that could be met using this excess subsurface heat. The team concluded that if surface temperature approaches the maximum plausible level, the percentage of sites where thermal pollution could feasibly contribute to meeting home heating needs will increase.  

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Benz and colleagues’ conclusion?  

A. Under both temperature conditions, less than  $10\%$   of sites were in the up-to $.25\%$   group, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, almost   $80\%$   of sites could have all their local heating needs met by thermal pollution.  
B. At current surface temperatures, more than  $80\%$   of the sites have no need for supplemental local home heating from subsurface thermal pollution, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, more than  $70\%$  of sites exhibit significantly greater home heating needs.  

C. At current surface temperatures, more than  $80\%$   of sites can meet, at most,  $25\%$   of local home heating needs with subsurface thermal pollution, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, more than  $80\%$   of sites can meet greater than  $25\%$   of local home heating needs.  

D. At current surface temperatures, more than  $80\%$   of the sites cannot use subsurface thermal pollution to meet any portion of local home heating needs, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, that percentage drops below  $20\%$  .  

# ID: be19faa1 Answer  

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures, there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs. By showing that only a small percentage of homes can currently use thermal pollution for home heating, and that this percentage would grow much larger at maximum plausible surface temperatures, this choice supports the researchers’ conclusion.  

Choice A is incorrect. We do not know how many sites could have all (i.e.,  $100\%$  ) of their local heating needs met by thermal pollution, as the graph only classifies sites by whether  $"0\%,$  ," "Up to  $25\%,"$   and "More than  $25\%"$   of heating needs could be met. Choice B is incorrect. The graph is not depicting need for supplemental heating from thermal pollution, but rather potential to use thermal pollution for supplemental heating. Choice C is incorrect. The graph indicates that, at current surface temperatures, less than  $10\%$   of sites can meet  $25\%$   of local home heating needs and that more than  $80\%$   of sites cannot meet any local home heating needs.

Neural networks are computer models intended to reflect the organization of human brains and are often used in studies of brain function. According to an analysis of 11,000 such networks, Rylan Schaeffer and colleagues advise caution when drawing conclusions about brains from observations of neural networks. They found that when attempting to mimic grid cells (brain cells used in navigation), while  $90\%$   of the networks could accomplish navigation-related tasks, only about   $10\%$   of those exhibited any behaviors similar to those of grid cells. But even this approximation of grid-cell activity has less to do with similarity between the neural networks and biological brains than it does with the rules programmed into the networks.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the claim in the underlined sentence?  

A. The rules that allow for networks to exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells have no equivalent in the function of biological brains. B. The networks that do not exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells were nonetheless programmed with rules that had proven useful in earlier neural-network studies. C. Neural networks can often accomplish tasks that biological brains do, but they are typically programmed with rules to model multiple types of brain cells simultaneously. D. Once a neural network is programmed, it is trained on certain tasks to see if it can independently arrive at  

processes that are similar to those performed by biological brains.  

# ID: dd1757fd Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. While many networks can perform navigation tasks, or even mimic grid cells, it doesn’t mean they’re actually behaving like biological brains—this finding suggests that the rules that govern neural network behavior are completely unlike the way real brains work.  

Choice B is incorrect. Although it mentions the rules that are programmed into the networks, this finding wouldn’t clarify whether or not these rules have anything to do with the function of biological brains. Choice C is incorrect. This choice suggests that neural networks are modeled after multiple types of brain cells, which sidesteps the question of whether these rule-based networks are genuinely similar to biological brains. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t address the key point of the claim, which is that the apparent similarity between neural networks and biological brains is only due to the rules programmed into the networks. It focuses on training tasks, not the originally programmed rules.

In the 1980s, many musicians and journalists in the English-speaking world began to draw attention to music from around the globe—such as mbaqanga from South Africa and quan họ from Vietnam—that can’t be easily categorized according to British or North American popular music genres, typically referring to such music as “world music.” While some scholars have welcomed this development for bringing diverse musical forms to prominence in countries where they’d previously been overlooked, musicologist Su Zheng claims that the concept of world music homogenizes highly distinct traditions by reducing them all to a single category.  

Which finding about mbaqanga and quan họ, if true, would most directly support Zheng’s claim? A. Mbaqanga and quan họ developed independently of each other and have little in common musically. B. Mbaqanga is significantly more popular in the English-speaking world than quan họ is.  

C. Mbaqanga and quan họ are now performed by a diverse array of musicians with no direct connections to South Africa or Vietnam.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. Zheng’s claim is that the idea of world music “homogenizes” (meaning makes similar) distinct kinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful oversimplification of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it’s true that mbaqanga and quan h ọ  developed separately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn’t make sense to lump them into the same category.  

Choice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity doesn’t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn’t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the music itself is similar or different. Choice C is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from each other that they should not fall into the same category. This choice doesn’t do that. Choice D is incorrect. If true, this would actually weaken the claim. Zheng thinks it’s reductive or oversimplifying to put distinct musical traditions into a single category. But if mbaqanga and quan h ọ  are similar to each other, then it would make sense to put them in the same category.

Archaeologists have held that the Casarabe culture, which emerged in the southwestern Amazon basin in the first millennium CE, was characterized by a sparse, widely distributed population and little intervention in the surrounding wilderness. Recently, however, archaeologist Heiko Prümers and colleagues conducted a study of the region using remote-sensing technology that enabled them to create three-dimensional images of the junglecovered landscape from above, and the researchers concluded that the Casarabe people developed a form of urbanism in the Amazon basin.  

Which finding about the remote-sensing images, if true, would most directly support Prümers and colleagues’ conclusion?  

A. They show shapes consistent with widely separated settlements of roughly equal small size surrounded by uncultivated jungle. B. They show shapes consistent with long-distance footpaths running from Casarabe territories to large cities outside the region inhabited by the Casarabe people. C.  They show shapes consistent with scattered small farms created by clearing jungle areas near sources of fresh water. D. They show shapes consistent with monumental platforms and dense central settlements linked to smaller  

settlements by a system of canals and roadways.  

# ID: 39e440e4 Answer  

Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This finding, if true, would support the archaeologists’ conclusion. Dense central settlements linked to smaller ones would provide evidence of cities and suburbs—in other words,  $^u{\mathrm{a}}$   form of urbanism.”  

Choice A is incorrect. This finding, if true, would weaken the archaeologists’ conclusion. Widely separated, small settlements with jungle in between would support the long-held belief that the Casarabe culture “was characterized by a sparse, widely distributed population and little intervention in the surrounding wilderness.” Choice B is incorrect. This choice wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion. These large cities are located outside Casarabe territory, which doesn’t show evidence of Casarabe urbanism. Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the archaeologists’ conclusion. Scattered small farms in jungle clearings are not good evidence to support the existence of cities (“a form of urbanism”).

Many governments that regularly transfer money to individuals—to provide supplemental incomes for senior citizens, for example—have long done so electronically, but other countries typically have distributed physical money and have only recently developed electronic transfer infrastructure. Researchers studied the introduction of an electronic transfer system in one such location and found that recipients of electronic transfers consumed a different array of foods than recipients of physical transfers of the same amount did. One potential explanation for this result is that individuals conceive of and allocate funds in physical money differently than they conceive of and allocate funds in electronic form.  

Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly weaken the potential explanation?  

A. Recipients of electronic transfers typically spent their funds at a slower rate than recipients of physical transfers did.  

B. Nearly every recipient of an electronic transfer withdrew the entire amount in physical money shortly after receiving the transfer.  

C. Recipients of physical transfers tended to purchase food about as frequently as recipients of electronic transfers did.  

D. Some recipients of physical transfers received small amounts of money relatively frequently, while others received large amounts relatively infrequently.  

# ID: 156ff681 Answer  

Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This would weaken the explanation. If the recipients of electronic money immediately withdrew it all as physical money, then both kinds of recipients ended up spending physical money on food. So there must be some other explanation why those who initially received electronic money ate different kinds of food.  

Choice A is incorrect. This wouldn’t weaken the explanation. If anything, it actually supports it: it demonstrates that recipients of electronic money and recipients of physical money have different spending habits. Choice C is incorrect. This wouldn’t weaken the explanation. The explanation we’re testing this choice against is about the way that people might “conceive of and allocate” physical and electronic funds differently. This choice only focuses on the timing, not what they spend the money on. Choice D is incorrect. This would have no impact on the explanation. It doesn’t tell us anything about possible differences between the spending habits of those who spend physical money and those who spend money electronically.

Icebergs generally appear to be mostly white or blue, depending on how the ice reflects sunlight. Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green. One team of scientists hypothesized that this phenomenon is the result of yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in Antarctic waters mixing with blue ice to produce the color green.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the team’s hypothesis? A. White ice doesn’t change color when mixed with dissolved organic carbon due to the air bubbles in the ice. B. Dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than it does in other places. C. Blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other. D. Blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon.  

# ID: 8545ccfe Answer  

Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the scientists’ hypothesis about icebergs that appear to be green. The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A finding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs’ green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green.  

Choice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists’ hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A finding that white ice, because of its air bubbles, doesn’t change color when it’s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists’ hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn’t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A finding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists’ hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists’ hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that’s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue. A finding that blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the researchers’ hypothesis.

Barchester Towers is an 1857 novel by Anthony Trollope. In the novel, Trollope’s portrayal of Dr. Proudie underscores the character’s exaggerated sense of his own abilities: ______  

Which quotation from Barchester Towers most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A. “It must not…be taken as proved that Dr. Proudie was a man of great mental powers, or even of much capacity for business, for such qualities had not been required in him.” B. “[Dr. Proudie] was comparatively young, and had, as he fondly flattered himself, been selected as possessing such gifts, natural and acquired, as must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.” C. “[Dr. Proudie’s] residence in the metropolis, rendered necessary by duties thus entrusted to him, his high connexions, and the peculiar talents and nature of the man, recommended him to persons in power.” D. “[Dr. Proudie] was certainly possessed of sufficient tact to answer the purpose for which he was required without making himself troublesome.”  

# ID: dc87adf4 Answer  

Correct Answer: B Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as "fondly flatter[ing] himself" that he has gifts that "must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice." In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support.  

Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not "proved," it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on.

An archaeological team led by Piotr Bieliński and Sultan al-Bakri found remnants of a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age board game at a site in Oman. Little is left of the game except a stone board, which is carved with a grid and has places to hold game pieces. Some scholars claim that the game was largely played by traders.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the scholars’ claim?  

A. Other examples of the game dating to the same period have been found in the remains of several homes in the region, including in one home that may have belonged to a trader. B. Similar games have been found in other sites dating to the same period that were connected to the site in Oman via trade routes. C. The other known examples of the game dating to the same period have been found along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders at the time.  

D. Remnants of other goods have been found at the site in Oman that probably also reached the location through trade.  

# ID: 3bfcb73b Answer  

Correct Answer: C Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the scholars’ claim about the board game. The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars’ claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled.  

Choice A is incorrect because this finding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the finding wouldn’t directly support the scholars’ claim that the majority of the game’s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this finding doesn’t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars’ claim about the board game. Choice D is incorrect because this finding doesn’t mention the board game at all, referring only to the remains of other goods found at the site in Oman, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars’ claim about the board game.

Median Ages of First Marriage for Men and Women in the United States and in England and Wales, 1900–2000  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e5e1035671ae23fd4cd482b4c124ad5e1bf7edd387bbcc05ce270c4e444a7695.jpg)  
A sociology student is reading an essay on the median age of first marriage in Western countries throughout the twentieth century. The author of the essay cites factors common to these countries that the author believes caused an increase in the median age of first marriage, such as new technologies that shortened the time needed for domestic chores, making two-person households less necessary and living alone more viable. The student asserts that beyond these factors there must be additional ones specific to particular Western countries that influenced the increase of age at first marriage.  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph that support the student’s assertion?  

A. Between 1970 and 2000, the median age of first marriage rose more sharply for men in England and Wales than it did for men in the United States.  

B. In England and Wales, the median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women between 1900 and 2000, but this was not always the case in the United States.  

C. The median age of first marriage for men in England and Wales was lower in 1970 than in 1950 or 1990.  
D. Between 1900 and 2000, the median age of first marriage for women in England and Wales was consistently higher than for women in the United States, as was the case for men.  

# ID: 53c6c179 Answer  

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. The student concluded that country-specific factors influence changes to median age of first marriage. This choice describes a time period when the rate of change differed between countries, suggesting that country-specific factors may have played a role in these changes.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women in the United States during the time period depicted. Choice C is incorrect. The student concluded that country-specific factors influence changes to median age of first marriage. However, this choice doesn’t provide any contrasts between countries and thus doesn’t support the idea of countryspecific factors influencing median age of first marriage. Choice D is incorrect. The students’ conclusion is about changes that occurred during the 20th century. This choice provides broad information about the century as a whole, so it doesn’t give insight into how median age at first marriage changed over time.

Several studies of sediment (e.g., dirt, pieces of rock, etc.) in streams have shown an inverse correlation between sediment grain size and downstream distance from the primary sediment source, suggesting that stream length has a sorting effect on sediment. In a study of sediment sampled at more than a dozen sites in Alpine streams, however, geologists Camille Litty and Fritz Schl un egg er found that cross-site variations in grain size were not associated with differences in downstream distance, though they did not conclude that downstream distance is irrelevant to grain size. Rather, they concluded that sediment influx in these streams may have been sufficiently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being observed.  

Which finding about the streams in the study, if true, would most directly support Litty and Schl un egg er’s conclusion?  

A. The streams regularly experience portions of their banks collapsing into the water at multiple points upstream of the sampling sites.  

B. The streams contain several types of sediment that are not typically found in streams where the sorting effect has been demonstrated.  

C. The streams mostly originate from the same source, but their lengths vary considerably due to the different courses they take.  

D. The streams are fed by multiple tributaries that carry significant volumes of sediment and that enter the streams downstream of the sampling sites.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer. This finding would support the conclusion. If stream banks are collapsing into the water at multiple points, then sediment is getting into the water at those various points. This supports the conclusion that the inflow of sediment is very spread out.  

Choice B is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. The conclusion is about the influx of sediment being “spatially diffuse,” meaning spread out over a large area. The type of sediment wouldn’t have an impact on the conclusions. Choice C is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t say anything about the influx of sediment being “spatially diffuse” (spread out). Choice D is incorrect. This finding wouldn’t support the conclusion. Any sediment that enters downstream of the sampling sites wouldn’t end up in the samples, so it wouldn’t affect the findings or the conclusion.

In vertical inheritance, parents pass genes to their offspring, but in horizontal transfer (HT), one species, often bacteria, passes genetic material to an unrelated species. In a 2022 study, her pe to logi st Atsushi Kura bay a shi and his team investigated HT in multicellular organisms—namely, snakes and frogs in Madagascar. The team detected BovB—a gene transmitted vertically in snakes—in many frog species. The apparent direction of gene transfer seems counter intuitive because frogs usually don’t survive encounters with snakes and so wouldn’t be able to transmit the newly acquired gene to offspring, but the team concluded that BovB is indeed transmitted from snakes to frogs, either directly or indirectly, via HT.  

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the team’s conclusion? A. BovB can be transmitted across frog species through HT. B. Parasites known to feed on species of snakes and frogs in which the BovB gene occurs also carry BovB.  

C. BovB cannot be reliably transmitted from a snake species to bacteria that are usually encountered by frog species.  

D. Frog species with BovB show few discernible advantages as compared with frog species that do not carry BovB.

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. If there are parasites that feed on both snakes and frogs, they could carry BovB from snakes to frogs. HT could occur “indirectly” through those encounters, which frogs are more likely to survive than snake encounters.  

Choice A is incorrect. The team’s conclusion specifically argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this choice doesn’t mention snakes. Choice C is incorrect. The team argues that BovB is transmitted from snakes to frogs via HT, and this answer choice discusses a scenario in which the gene is not transmitted. Choice D is incorrect. Whether or not frog species with BovB are advantaged isn’t relevant to the team’s conclusion about how the gene is transmitted.

Aerial robots vary considerably in their holding force; the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand, for example, has a holding force of 56 newtons, more than twice that of the Permanent Magnet Hand and more than four times that of the Yale Model T. Since an aerial robot must lift its own weight along with its cargo, engineer Jiawei Meng and colleagues used a ratio of each robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight to calculate payload capacity, with higher ratios corresponding to greater capacity, concluding that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.  

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion? A. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T each weigh more than 450 grams. B. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T each weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does. C. The Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand despite weighing more. D. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T does.  
Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.  

Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the UltraFast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the UltraFast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,  information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T.

Electra is a circa 420–410 BCE play by Sophocles, translated in 1870 by R.C. Jebb. Electra, who is in mourning for her dead father and her long-absent brother, is aware of the intensity of her grief but believes it to be justified:  

Which quotation from Electra most effectively illustrates the claim?  

A.  $"\textdegree$   thou pure sunlight, and thou air, earth’s canopy, how often have ye heard the strains of my lament, the wild blows dealt against this bleeding breast, when dark night fails!” B. “Send to me my brother; for I have no more the strength to bear up alone against the load of grief that weighs me down.” C. “I know my own passion, it escapes me not; but, seeing that the causes are so dire, will never curb these frenzied plaints, while life is in me.”  

D. “But never will I cease from dirge and sore lament, while I look on the trembling rays of the bright stars, or on this light of day.”  

# ID: af9e3240 Answer  

Correct Answer: C  

Rationale  

Choice C is the best answer. Electra states that she “knows her own passion,” which shows that she’s aware of the intensity of her grief. But she also claims that the “causes are so dire”—meaning the reasons for her grief are so awful—that she can’t let it go, which shows that she believes her grief is justified.  

Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t show that Electra believes her grief is justified. It shows that Electra is aware of its intensity, but it doesn’t suggest that she believes she has a legitimate reason for feeling that way. Choice B is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t show that Electra believes her grief is justified. It shows that Electra is aware of its intensity, but it doesn’t suggest that she believes she has a legitimate reason for feeling that way. Choice D is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t show that Electra believes her grief is justified. It shows that Electra is aware of the intensity of her grief, but it doesn’t suggest that she has a legitimate reason for feeling that way.

Tadpole Body Mass and Toxin Production after Three Weeks in Ponds  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/92cf839020562f1a040a29685de59cf7706aaaaba70b4c1d662a2a734dd0b000.jpg)  

Ecologist Veronika Bókony and colleagues investigated within-species competition among common toads (Bufo bufo), a species that secretes various unpleasant-tasting toxins called b ufa die noli des in response to threats. The researchers tested B. bufo tadpoles’ responses to different levels of competition by creating ponds with different tadpole population densities but a fixed amount of food. Based on analysis of the tadpoles after three weeks, the researchers concluded that increased competition drove b ufa die noli de production at the expense of growth.  

Which choice uses data from the table to most effectively support the researchers’ conclusion?  

A. The difference in average tadpole body mass was small between the low and medium population density conditions and substantially larger between the low and high population density conditions.  

B. Tadpoles in the low and medium population density conditions had substantially lower average b ufa die noli de concentrations but had greater average body masses than those in the high population density condition.  

C. Tadpoles in the high population density condition displayed a relatively modest increase in the average amount of b ufa die noli de but roughly double the average b ufa die noli de concentration compared to those in the low population density condition.  

D. Tadpoles produced approximately the same number of different b ufa die noli de toxins per individual across the population density conditions, but average tadpole body mass decreased as population density increased.

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. This data shows that the tadpoles in the high-density pond (meaning those with the most competition) didn’t grow as big as the other two groups but produced more b ufa die noli de.  
Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t fully support the conclusion. It doesn’t include any data about b ufa die noli de production. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t fully support the conclusion. It doesn’t include any data about growth. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t fully support the conclusion. It doesn’t demonstrate that the tadpoles in the high-density pond produced more b ufa die noli de overall. The fact that they didn’t produce more kinds of b ufa die noli de isn’t relevant to the conclusion.

# Swahili Speakers in Three African Countries

Swahili is estimated to be the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. It’s also an officially recognized language in Tanzania, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which means these countries use Swahili in government documents and proceedings. But even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili, for many it isn’t their first language but is instead their second, third, or even fourth language.  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim?  

A. Tanzania has approximately 61 million Swahili speakers, which is much more than the estimated total number of people worldwide for whom Swahili is their first language.  

B. Tanzania is estimated to have at most 15 million Swahili speakers, while the country’s total population is approximately 61 million people.  

C. Approximately 100 percent of the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in Kenya, which has a total population of approximately 55 million people.  

D. Approximately 100 percent of Kenya’s population speaks Swahili, while only about 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speaks Swahili.

Correct Answer: A  

Rationale  

Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language’s speakers don’t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries  
where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language).  

Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania’s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country’s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya’s total population can be inferred from the table—if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and  $100\%$   of Kenya’s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people—nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya’s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn’t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language.

Participants rated how congested it seemed before the obstacle, after the obstacle, and overall, and the researchers correlated those ratings with velocity and density. (Correlations range from  $^{-1}$   to 1, with greater distance from 0 indicating greater strength). The researchers concluded that the correlations with velocity are stronger than those with density.  

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ conclusion?  

A. The correlation between congestion ratings before the obstacle and density is further from 0 than the correlation between overall congestion rating and velocity is.  

B. The correlation between congestion ratings before the obstacle and velocity is further from 0 than the correlation between congestion overall and velocity is.  

C. For each of the three ratings, the correlation with velocity is negative while the correlation with density is positive.  

D. For each of the three ratings, correlations with velocity are further from 0 than the corresponding correlations with density are.

Correct Answer: D  

Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the farther the correlation is from 0, the “stronger” it is (doesn’t matter if it’s negative or positive). The table shows that the correlations with velocity are farther from zero than the correlations with density, which supports the conclusion that the correlations with velocity are stronger.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. It makes an “apples to oranges” comparison by comparing density and velocity correlations across features instead of comparing them for each feature. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t include the density correlations for comparison. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. The text tells us that the  
farther the correlation is from 0, the “stronger” it is: it doesn’t matter for “strength” whether it’s negative or positive.

A member of the Otomi, an Indigenous people in Central Mexico, Octavio Medellín immigrated to the United States as a child, and his sculpture bears the impress of traditions on both sides of the border: US-based modernist sculpture, Mexican modernist painting, Otomi art, and the ancient sculpture of other Mexican Indigenous peoples, including the Maya. In his 1950 masterpiece History of Mexico, Medellín fuses these influences into a style so idiosyncratic that it resists efforts to view his work through the lens of nationality or cultural identity. Artists, he insisted, should strive for individual expression, even as they draw inspiration from their heritage and the communities where they live and work.  

Which quotation from an art critic most directly challenges the underlined claim in the text?  

A. “Although a number of ancient Indigenous artistic traditions pictured human forms in profile, the forms populating the surface of A History of Mexico suggest a specifically Maya influence.” B. “In A History of Mexico, the synthesis of ancient and modernist traditions functions as a stylistic parallel to the work’s subject matter: a survey of centuries of Mexican history.” C. “Many critics focus on Indigenous influences in A History of Mexico and other key works by Medellín to the exclusion of influences from non-Indigenous art.” D. “While A History of Mexico features modernist motifs, it relies primarily on angular human forms in profile—a staple of Maya sculpture—and thus invites classification as Indigenous art.”  

# ID: 378c66d5 Answer  

Correct Answer: D Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity.  

Choice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be defined by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous influences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the influences equally—that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses.

Corn-Related Vocabulary in Various Southeastern Languages  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/539ef6adf9a2a0617da85c28c10175372fc4004248e5aa6c0ae459dc3a4d769c.jpg)  

In Caddo, a language from what is now the US Southeast, vocabulary pertaining to corn cultivation resembles equivalent vocabulary in the To to zoquean language family in Mexico. This resemblance is perhaps attributable to cultural contact: such words could have entered Caddo through the intermediary of the neighboring but unrelated Chitimacha language, concurrent with the dissemination of corn itself from Mexico into the Southeast after 700 CE. That the vocabulary pertaining to domestic crops accompanies them as they diffuse into new regions is an established phenomenon globally. Crops may also be decoupled from vocabulary altogether: corn cultivation became ubiquitous among the Southeastern tribes, yet ______  

Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?  

A. the origins of vocabulary pertaining to the crop vary across languages in the region, with the words for corn in Cherokee and the Muskogean languages showing no demonstrable relationship to To to zoquean vocabulary.  

B. the region is linguistically diverse, being home not only to Chitimacha and Caddo, but also to the Muskogean language family (including Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscogee) and to one Iroquoian language (Cherokee).  

C. corn-related vocabulary underwent changes when entering other, unrelated languages, as can be seen by the divergence of the Caddo word from the Chitimacha word it originated in.  

D. words for corn in the languages of the Muskogean family evolved from a common root, with the Muscogee word having lost certain consonant sounds still present in the Chickasaw and Choctaw words.  

# ID: 35ec767c Answer  

Correct Answer: A Rationale  
Choice A is the best answer. The table provides evidence that the words for corn in the Cherokee and Muskogean languages appear unrelated to those in Caddo language, which is described as closely related to the To to zoquean language family. This supports the claim that corn cultivation spread across the Southeast without necessarily spreading To to zoquean vocabulary along with it.  

Choice B is incorrect. This choice emphasizes the diversity of Southeastern languages in general, but we’re specifically looking for information about words associated with corn. Choice C is incorrect. This choice shows how words for corn can change and evolve, but we’re looking for an example that shows how some words for corn can be completely unrelated. Choice D is incorrect. This choice shows words for corn that share a common root, but we’re looking for an example that shows how some words for corn can be unrelated.

Percentage Point Changes in US Federal Outlays Relative to GDP by Congressional Status 
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e059e0e0697182404b47902ba041728d7be1611965290ac5518121e20c92887d.jpg)  

Economist Steve H. Hanke has shown that divided US Congresses—which occur when one party holds the majority in the House of Representatives and another holds the majority in the Senate—tend to accompany reductions in total federal outlays (spending) relative to gross domestic product (GDP), which Hanke interprets to reflect decreases in government size. Hanke calculated the percentage point change in total outlays (encompassing nondefense and defense outlays) for consecutive US Congresses. Hanke has pointed to his calculations as evidence that a divided Congress may be a “necessary but not sufficient condition” for a decrease in government size to occur.  

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the underlined claim?  

A. The periods of undivided Congresses were associated with increases in nondefense outlays, whereas all the periods of divided Congresses except one were associated with reductions in defense outlays.  

B. All the periods of divided Congresses were associated with reductions in total outlays, although two periods were also associated with increases in nondefense outlays.  

C. The periods of undivided Congresses were associated with increases in total outlays, whereas all the periods of divided Congresses were associated with reductions in either nondefense outlays or defense outlays.  

D. All the periods of divided Congresses except one were associated with reductions in total outlays, whereas the periods of undivided Congresses were associated with increases in total outlays.  
Rationale  

Choice D is the best answer. The claim is that divided Congresses are necessary but insufficient—that is, we need divide Congresses, but they are not enough—to decrease government size, as measured by total federal outlays. This choice accurately expresses the supporting data from the “change in total outlays” part of the graph. Within the data set, divided Congresses sometimes decreased total outlays, but undivided ones never did.  

Choice A is incorrect. The claim is only about government size, as measured by total federal outlays—defense and nondefense outlays aren’t relevant. Choice B is incorrect. The claim is only about government size as measured by total federal outlays—nondefense outlays aren’t relevant. Choice C is incorrect. The claim is only about government size as measured by total federal outlays—specific information about defense or nondefense outlays isn’t relevant.

Distribution of Ecosystem Services Affected by Invasive Species by Service Type  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/d53087a810a16091153930da7d15f102e34da295fbff86de646bfd759edcf739.jpg)  

To assess the impact of invasive species on ecosystems in Africa, Benis N. Egoh and colleagues reviewed government reports from those nations about how invasive species are undermining ecosystem services (aspects of the ecosystem on which residents depend). The services were sorted into three categories: provisioning (material resources from the ecosystem), regulating (natural processes such as cleaning the air or water), and cultural (non material benefits of ecosystems). Egoh and her team assert that countries in each region reported effects on provisioning services and that provisioning services represent the majority of the reported services.  

Which choice best describes data from the table that support Egoh and colleagues’ assertion?  

A. Provisioning services represent   $73\%$   of the services reported for the West region and   $33\%$   of those for the Central region, but they represent  $75\%$   of the services reported overall.  

B. None of the percentages shown for provisioning services are lower than  $33\%_{\prime}$   and the overall percentage shown for provisioning services is   $75\%$  .  

C. Provisioning services are shown for each region, while no cultural services are shown for some regions.  

D. The greatest percentage shown for provisioning services is  $88\%$   for the North region, and the least shown for provisioning services is   $33\%$   for the Central region.

Correct Answer: B  

Rationale  

Choice B is the best answer. The finding that all the regions reported at least some effects on provisioning services supports the first part of the assertion. And the fact that provisioning services comprise  $75\%$   of the reported services overall supports the second part of the assertion.  

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t fully support the assertion. It doesn’t include the finding that all the regions (not just Central and West) reported at least some effects on provisioning services. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t fully support the assertion. It doesn’t demonstrate that provisioning services  
represent the majority of the reported services overall. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t fully support the assertion. It doesn’t demonstrate that provisioning services represent the majority of the reported services overall.
