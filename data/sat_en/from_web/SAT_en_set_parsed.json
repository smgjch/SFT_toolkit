Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers&rsquo; decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential.

                "content": "The correct answer is Option B. Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms&rsquo; morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms&rsquo; structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers&rsquo; decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count and Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s study.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference&mdash;it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.&nbsp;</p>"

such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo analyzed trends in news reports to derive measures not only for general economic policy uncertainty but also for uncertainty related to specific areas of economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One revelation of her work is that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where general economic policy uncertainty <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p> <p>Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to illustrate the claim?</p> Options: A. <p>aligned closely with uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2005 but differed from uncertainty about tax and public spending policy by a large amount in 2009.</p> B. <p>was substantially lower than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy each year from 2005 to 2010.</p> C. <p>reached its highest level between 2005 and 2010 in the same year that uncertainty about trade policy and tax and public spending policy reached their lowest levels.</p> D. <p>was substantially lower than uncertainty about trade policy in 2005 and substantially higher than uncertainty about trade policy in 2010.</p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option D. Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively illustrate the text&rsquo;s claim about general economic policy uncertainty in the United Kingdom. The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy specifically (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that the level of general economic policy uncertainty was similar to the level of uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in both 2005 (with values of approximately 90 and 100, respectively) and 2009 (with values of approximately 80 and 75, respectively).&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty was higher than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2006, 2007, and 2009, not that it was lower each year from 2005 to 2010. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that general economic policy uncertainty reached its highest level in 2010, which was when uncertainty about tax and public spending policy also reached its highest level, not its lowest level. </p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option D. Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years&mdash;1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees&mdash;grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.&nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his colleagues&rsquo; findings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don&rsquo;t make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn&rsquo;t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn&rsquo;t show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female. </p>"

The description of <em>Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945&ndash;1965</em> indicates that Enwezor and Siegel&rsquo;s exhibition brought works by African artists together with works by artists from other countries, thus supporting the arts journalist&rsquo;s claim that Enwezor sought to show works by African artists in a context of global modern art and art history. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it describes a retrospective that wouldn&rsquo;t support the arts journalist&rsquo;s claim that Enwezor wanted to show how works by modern African artists fit into the larger context of global modern art and art history. The description of <em>El Anatsui: Triumphant Scale</em> indicates that the retrospective focused only on the work of a single African artist, El Anatsui. The description doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the exhibition showed how El Anatsui&rsquo;s works fit into a global artistic context.

The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reflects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines&mdash;the waves&mdash;isn&rsquo;t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect.

According to the text, Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies address broad themes that continue to appeal to today&rsquo;s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays.

Since twentieth-century plays aren&rsquo;t mentioned, there&rsquo;s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today&rsquo;s audiences.

The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that it&rsquo;s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn&rsquo;t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers&rsquo; claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn&rsquo;t weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn&rsquo;t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim. </p>"

And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues figured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn&rsquo;t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn&rsquo;t address the relative importance of each component in that process.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure. Nothing in the text indicates why it took so long to prove the existence of this crystal or take an impression of it. </p>"

According to the text, some Euro-American farmers were using these techniques in the early nineteenth century despite few of the farmers having seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn&rsquo;t learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn&rsquo;t invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques.

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about the harvesting of clamshells by Neanderthals for use as tools. The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text&rsquo;s description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population fluctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. </p>"

homeostatically regulated: animals compensate for periods of REM sleep deprivation by increasing subsequent REM sleep. When on land, fur seals get enough REM sleep, but during the weeks they\u2019re in the water, they get almost none. In a study of fur seals\u2019 sleep habits, researchers recorded the REM sleep (as a percentage of baseline) of fur seals once they had returned to land.

If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We&rsquo;d also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This doesn&rsquo;t support the conclusion. If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then we&rsquo;d suspect the seals to sustain REM levels well above baseline for a prolonged period in order to compensate for weeks of REM deprivation while in the water. Whether or not there&rsquo;s a reduction in REM sleep from day 1 to day 2 doesn&rsquo;t tell us how REM sleep on those days relates to baseline, which is where our focus should be. Choice B is incorrect. The y-axis of this graph doesn&rsquo;t depict baseline levels of REM sleep, but rather shows REM sleep as a percent of baseline. Choice D is incorrect. The graph doesn&rsquo;t depict REM sleep while in the water for the seals in the study. Additionally, we&rsquo;re told fur seals get no REM sleep while in the water, which is significantly different to the values shown in the graph for after they return to land. </p>"

climate create thermal pollution (excess heat) in the shallow subsurface soil. Susanne A. Benz and colleagues analyzed thousands of sites on three continents under one scenario in which surface temperature remains at the current level and under another in which the surface reaches the maximum plausible temperature. They then categorized each site according to the percentage of local home heating needs that could be met using this excess subsurface heat. The team concluded that if surface temperature approaches the maximum plausible level, the percentage of sites where thermal pollution could feasibly contribute to meeting home heating needs will increase.</p> <p>Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Benz and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion?</p> Options: A. <p>Under both temperature conditions, less than 10% of sites were in the up-to-25% group, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, almost 80% of sites could have all their local heating needs met by thermal pollution.</p> B. <p>At current surface temperatures, more than 80% of the sites have no need for supplemental local home heating from subsurface thermal pollution, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, more than 70% of sites exhibit significantly greater home heating needs.</p> C. <p>At current surface temperatures, more than 80% of sites can meet, at most, 25% of local home heating needs with subsurface thermal pollution, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, more than 80% of sites can meet greater than 25% of local home heating needs.</p> D. <p>At current surface temperatures, more than 80% of the sites cannot use subsurface thermal pollution to meet any portion of local home heating needs, but at the maximum plausible surface temperature, that percentage drops below 20%.&nbsp;</p>"

The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures, there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs. By showing that only a small percentage of homes can currently use thermal pollution for home heating, and that this percentage would grow much larger at maximum plausible surface temperatures, this choice supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We do not know how many sites could have all (i.e., 100%) of their local heating needs met by thermal pollution, as the graph only classifies sites by whether \"0%,\" \"Up to 25%,\" and \"More than 25%\" of heating needs could be met. Choice B is incorrect. The graph is not depicting need for supplemental heating from thermal pollution, but rather potential to use thermal pollution for supplemental heating. Choice C is incorrect. The graph indicates that, at current surface temperatures, less than 10% of sites can meet 25% of local home heating needs and that more than 80% of sites cannot meet any local home heating needs.</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991&ndash;1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996&ndash;2001 period it was four, and during the 2001&ndash;2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991&ndash;1995 and 2001&ndash;2008 periods; thus, it isn&rsquo;t true that the average numbers didn&rsquo;t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001&ndash;2008 period, not in the 1996&ndash;2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time&mdash;to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time. </p>"

The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found that propane yielded faster results.

The text indicates that &ldquo;until recently,&rdquo; superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using &ldquo;thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,&rdquo; which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons.

Choice C is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to occur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts. Choice D is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would be no superfluorescence at room temperature.

The text indicates that the sweet potato is found in Polynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potato was being cultivated by Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in Polynesia long before sea voyages between South America and Polynesia began. The text goes on to note that research by Mu&ntilde;oz-Rodr&iacute;guez and colleagues has established that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato split from South American varieties more than 100,000 years ago, which is thousands of years before humans settled in Polynesia. If Polynesian peoples were cultivating the sweet potato before sea voyages between Polynesia and South America began, and if Polynesian varieties of sweet potato diverged from South American varieties well before people were in Polynesia, it can reasonably be concluded that humans didn&rsquo;t play a role in bringing the sweet potato to Polynesia.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect.

Therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t be reasonable to conclude that Polynesian peoples acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples.

The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros&rsquo;s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character&rsquo;s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn&rsquo;t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren&rsquo;t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella&rsquo;s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren&rsquo;t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that <em>The House on Mango Street</em> has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn&rsquo;t relate directly to the text&rsquo;s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Stree</em>t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros&rsquo;s novella, such similarities wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how <em>The House on Mango Street</em> had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence.&nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes.

Choice B is incorrect because the quotation has to do with an upcoming event during Mrs. Spring Fragrance&rsquo;s trip&mdash;visiting San Jos&eacute; and meeting someone new&mdash;rather than her concern for what&rsquo;s happening at home. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation is focused on how Mrs. Spring Fragrance feels about her trip and the friends she&rsquo;s seeing, not on her concern for what&rsquo;s happening at home. </p>"

Churchill&rsquo;s play was influenced by Brecht&rsquo;s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was influenced by Brecht&rsquo;s belief that plays should provoke audience members &ldquo;to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters&rsquo; beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorrect. Reflecting on things that aren&rsquo;t related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism.&rdquo; That creates a confusing contradiction. Choice C is incorrect. No mention is made of social and political issues in Germany during Brecht&rsquo;s time, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. </p>"

The text states that some scholars have dated the composition of <em>Beowulf</em> to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries due to the poem&rsquo;s fit with that period&rsquo;s historical context. The text goes on to say that while it is &ldquo;not inconceivable that <em>Beowulf</em> emerged from such a context&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it is possible that <em>Beowulf</em> was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries&mdash;there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century. According to the text, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justification that scholars have not yet supplied. In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem&rsquo;s fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the evidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other words, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date, only that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its fit with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it fits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries. Rather, the text says that there is linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed in the seventh or eighth century.&nbsp;</p>"

Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there&rsquo;s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings.

Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student&rsquo;s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don&rsquo;t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn&rsquo;t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the team&rsquo;s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals&rsquo; domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team&rsquo;s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet&mdash;importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle&rsquo;s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team&rsquo;s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops&mdash;and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep&rsquo;s and goats&rsquo; diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team&rsquo;s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn&rsquo;t support the team&rsquo;s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle&rsquo;s diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team&rsquo;s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements&rsquo; crops. </p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option C. Rationale: <p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of scholars&rsquo; understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn&rsquo;t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don&rsquo;t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn&rsquo;t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren&rsquo;t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have marketplaces, it wouldn&rsquo;t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don&rsquo;t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn&rsquo;t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn&rsquo;t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products. </p>"

Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual&rsquo;s capacity to form associative memories. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual&rsquo;s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things. Choice D is incorrect because the text never discusses how fan cells are initially created and therefore provides no evidence for a conclusion about how receiving a reward would affect their creation.&nbsp;</p>"

The text indicates that the proportion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs is considerably higher than the proportion of military veterans in the population as a whole. The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures&nbsp; shared by civilian government entities and the military.

The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student&rsquo;s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is &ldquo;entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,&rdquo; meaning that the spider population wouldn&rsquo;t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn&rsquo;t weaken the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren&rsquo;t the only cause of the reduction.&nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of <em>A. mexicanus</em>. According to the text, <em>A. mexicanus</em>, a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river fish and the cave fish, not that the river fish and cave fish are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species. </p>"

According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers&rsquo; claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn&rsquo;t have any bearing on the researchers&rsquo; claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn&rsquo;t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn&rsquo;t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn&rsquo;t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true&mdash;that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn&rsquo;t have any bearing on the researchers&rsquo; claim about people behaving altruistically.

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data in the graph supporting Ayalew and her colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis that plants&rsquo; response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals. The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million. </p>"

Choice C is incorrect because the quotation focuses on the fact that Braschi studied in several different cities, which doesn&rsquo;t address the student&rsquo;s claim that Braschi&rsquo;s creation of cross-genre literature inspires diverse types of responses.

According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand. </p>"

The author of the essay cites factors common to these countries that the author believes caused an increase in the median age of first marriage, such as new technologies that shortened the time needed for domestic chores, making two-person households less necessary and living alone more viable. The student asserts that beyond these factors there must be additional ones specific to particular Western countries that influenced the increase of age at first marriage.</p> <p>Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph that support the student&rsquo;s assertion?</p> Options: A. <p>Between 1970 and 2000, the median age of first marriage rose more sharply for men in England and Wales than it did for men in the United States.</p> B. <p>In England and Wales, the median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women between 1900 and 2000, but this was not always the case in the United States.</p> C. <p>The median age of first marriage for men in England and Wales was lower in 1970 than in 1950 or 1990.</p> D. <p>Between 1900 and 2000, the median age of first marriage for women in England and Wales was consistently higher than for women in the United States, as was the case for men.</p>"

This choice misreads the graph. The median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women in the United States during the time period depicted. Choice C is incorrect. The student concluded that country-specific factors influence changes to median age of first marriage. However, this choice doesn&rsquo;t provide any contrasts between countries and thus doesn&rsquo;t support the idea of country-specific factors influencing median age of first marriage. Choice D is incorrect. The students&rsquo; conclusion is about changes that occurred during the 20th century. This choice provides broad information about the century as a whole, so it doesn&rsquo;t give insight into how median age at first marriage changed over time. </p>"

The text tells us that lemons&mdash;an expensive imported product&mdash;feature in Dutch paintings of the period more frequently than dairy products do. Since it&rsquo;s unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts doubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a \"major component of the Dutch diet,\" while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than dairy products. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn&rsquo;t mention painters from other countries, so there&rsquo;s no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests that Dutch painters do have reasons for depicting foods other than to show what Dutch people typically ate.

The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants&rsquo; medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations&rsquo; lands. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities&rsquo; languages. Given this relationship, it is unlikely globally dominant languages would borrow Indigenous vocabulary pertaining to &nbsp;plants&rsquo; medicinal uses.

The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn&rsquo;t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn&rsquo;t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn&rsquo;t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn&rsquo;t available until the early 1900s doesn&rsquo;t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn&rsquo;t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge&mdash;and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers&mdash;of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s.

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles.

Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells&rsquo; efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor&rsquo;s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor&rsquo;s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about spray coating&rsquo;s potential value. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn&rsquo;t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating. </p>"

Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s <em>The Birds</em>, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist&rsquo;s point of view.

The table shows the ablation rates for three elements&mdash;iron, potassium, and sodium&mdash;found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example&mdash;the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types. </p>"

The graph shows that between 1981 and 2010 Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela all had an average rainfall during the month of September of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n had an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Describing the average September rainfall of Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela as below 8 inches and the average September rainfall of San Sebasti&aacute;n as greater than 8 inches therefore offers an accurate description of the data in the graph and most effectively completes the statement. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it offers an inaccurate interpretation of the data in the graph. The graph shows that in September, Rinc&oacute;n, Isabela, and Ponce all have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Therefore, Rinc&oacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is the same as, not greater than, that of Isabela and Ponce, and it is below, not greater than, that of San Sebasti&aacute;n. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph.

Choice D is incorrect because although the graph shows a similar average rainfall (about 6 inches) for Rinc&oacute;n and Isabela in September, it doesn&rsquo;t show that Ponce has a similar average rainfall to San Sebasti&aacute;n during this month. In September, Ponce&rsquo;s average rainfall is about 6 inches, whereas San Sebasti&aacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is nearly 11 inches. </p>"

A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians.

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the student&rsquo;s argument about the role of bufadienolide in the egg preferences of cane toad tadpoles. For each of five amphibian species included in the 2022 study, the table gives the percentage of available eggs that the cane toad tadpoles ate. According to the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of striped burrowing frog eggs and 1% of dainty green tree frog eggs, which suggests a preference for striped burrowing frog eggs over dainty green tree frog eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species&rsquo; eggs produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data suggest that something other than the presence or absence of bufadienolide is needed to adequately explain the tadpoles&rsquo; egg preferences.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the table shows that for each of the five amphibian species, the cane toad tadpoles ate less than 100% of that species&rsquo; eggs, which demonstrates that the tadpoles did indeed leave some eggs for each species unharmed, this fact alone is irrelevant to the tadpoles&rsquo; preferences for some species&rsquo; eggs over other species&rsquo; eggs. Choice C is incorrect. Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles&rsquo; preference for some species&rsquo; eggs over other species&rsquo; eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species&rsquo; eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don&rsquo;t indicate bufadienolide&rsquo;s role in the tadpoles&rsquo; egg preferences.</p>"

The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do.

If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies&rsquo; tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males&rsquo; tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn&rsquo;t address differences between the subspecies or female preferences.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven&rsquo;t changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies. </p>"

As this choice does not compare e-book sales of story genres to e-book sales in genres that are not stories, it does not support the claim. Choice D is incorrect. Although the data in the table show that the travel guide e-books made up a greater percentage of total sales in 2016 than in 2011, this doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the claim in the text that e-books in nonfiction genres not meant to be read straight through are less commercially successful. The claim cannot be supported without comparing the percentage of e-book sales between fiction and nonfiction book genres from the table.&nbsp;</p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option D. Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues&rsquo; assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues&rsquo; assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets&mdash;TOI-1478 b&mdash;does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets&rsquo; radius values irrelevant. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to the text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot&rsquo;s holding force to the robot&rsquo;s weight, and higher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T&rsquo;s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it&rsquo;s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn&rsquo;t support Meng and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it&rsquo;s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the Permanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn&rsquo;t support Meng and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has a lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding force. Moreover,&nbsp; information about the Permanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the conclusion by Meng and colleagues, which only concerns the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student&rsquo;s claim about the film <em>One Night in Miami&hellip;</em>. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn&rsquo;t initially plan to write a story only &ldquo;focusing on the meeting itself&rdquo; but rather had considered writing a &ldquo;much longer&rdquo; and more expansive work about the meeting&rsquo;s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film&rsquo;s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn&rsquo;t specify to what extent Powers&rsquo;s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened.

This choice misreads the graph. The percentage of newly installed turbines with rotor diameters greater than 130 meters didn&rsquo;t show any visible increase until 2018. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t justify the claim. The claim is about increasing energy output from 2011 to 2021, but this choice only discusses 2011, so it can&rsquo;t show evidence of change over time.

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of the study of capuchin monkeys&rsquo; cognitive abilities. The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn&rsquo;t account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned to the capuchin monkeys in the study varied in difficulty and that the variety wasn&rsquo;t taken into consideration. The text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the capuchin monkeys couldn&rsquo;t perform certain tasks, just that some tasks were more difficult to do. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the study&rsquo;s results are indicative of the abilities of capuchin monkeys but not of other monkey species; in fact, the text suggests that the results may not even be an accurate reflection of capuchin monkeys&rsquo; abilities.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the researchers compared results for artificial tasks with those for tasks encountered in the wild, although the tasks described in the text&mdash;sliding a panel and putting a straw in a bottle&mdash;are presumably artificial. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens&rsquo;s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that &ldquo;the more informed voters are about politics&hellip;the more likely they are to vote.&rdquo; This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens&rsquo;s claim about how level of information affects voters. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters&rsquo; probability of voting, not whether they&rsquo;re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru&rsquo;s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth&rsquo;s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; claim.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, not strengthen it. Such a finding would suggest that the ITCZ shifted south and left Central America dry rather than expanding both northward and southward.&nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them&mdash;that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000&ndash;57,000 newtons and 35,000&ndash;63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000&ndash;235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000&ndash;34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn&rsquo;t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson&rsquo;s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can&rsquo;t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don&rsquo;t support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates. </p>"

The text indicates that <em>A. thaliana</em> plants show accelerated flowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated flowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of <em>A. thaliana</em> plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn&rsquo;t show accelerated flowering.

According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls&rsquo; chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls&rsquo; origin. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn&rsquo;t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There&rsquo;s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck.\n&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn&rsquo;t the text&rsquo;s main idea. Rather, it&rsquo;s a detail that&rsquo;s provided to develop the main idea, which is that the researchers used a special tool to determine where the bowls had been produced. </p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option B. Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of Andr&eacute; Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues&rsquo; computer simulations of our solar system&rsquo;s development. The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring&mdash;that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth&rsquo;s real size, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring&rsquo;s formation was important in determining Earth&rsquo;s eventual size.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that this was an initial simulation&mdash;that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring&rsquo;s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets&rsquo; eventual size in the researchers&rsquo; simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring&rsquo;s formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system&rsquo;s planets. Rather, the text states that the simulations showed that the innermost planets formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. &nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis about the plants&rsquo; dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage&mdash;such as access to phosphorous&mdash;from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don&rsquo;t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don&rsquo;t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn&rsquo;t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There&rsquo;s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn&rsquo;t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks. </p>"

However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven&rsquo;t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren&rsquo;t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager&rsquo;s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird&rsquo;s overall fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because Shultz&rsquo;s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers&rsquo; feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness.

Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of the study by Versace and colleagues. The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they&rsquo;re social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues&rsquo; experiment, which showed that <em>Testudo</em> tortoises, which aren&rsquo;t social and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn&rsquo;t social and doesn&rsquo;t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can&rsquo;t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren&rsquo;t social and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises&rsquo; responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported. </p>"

                "content": "The correct answer is Option B. Rationale: <p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017&ndash;2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph&mdash;in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre&mdash;a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.&nbsp;</p>"

Areas with mangroves are great places for young fish since they help keep these fish fed and protected while they grow. To study the importance of mangroves to young fish, researchers Mohamed A.Abu El-Regal and Nesreen K. Ibrahim collected and identified young fish from three different mangrove sites in the Egyptian Red Sea. They collected fish in the winter, spring, and autumn of 2010, collecting a total of 269 fish from 21 different species.

The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to active multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team&rsquo;s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors.

The graph shows the number of organic farms located in each of six US states in 2016: between 2,600 and 2,800 in California; between 1,200 and 1,400 in Wisconsin; between 1,000 and 1,200 in New York; approximately 800 in Pennsylvania; and between 600 and 800 in both Iowa and Washington.&nbsp;The last sentence of the text provides information about the number of organic farms in 2016, first describing the number in California. The best completion of the sentence is the choice that accurately describes the number of organic farms in 2016 in another state, which the assertion that Washington had between 600 and 800 organic farms provides. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that there were between 1,000 and 1,200 organic farms in New York, not fewer than 800 organic farms.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. While the graph indicates that there were between 1,200 and 1,400 organic farms in Wisconsin in 2016, there were only between 600 and 800 in Iowa. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that in 2016 there were approximately 800 organic farms in Pennsylvania, not more than 1,200.&nbsp;</p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it&rsquo;s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn&rsquo;t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn&rsquo;t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn&rsquo;t advantageous.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.&nbsp;</p>"

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn&rsquo;t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn&rsquo;t supported by the text. </p>"

The text explains that the <em>Cantares Mexicanos</em> contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers&rsquo; unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain&rsquo;s. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some of the poems make &ldquo;inarguable references&rdquo; to common Spanish customs, which conflicts with the idea that these references can reasonably be attributed to mere coincidence. </p>"

In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the &ldquo;developer&rdquo; to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of &ldquo;slab&rdquo; paintings from that decade. &nbsp;Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in &ldquo;one gesture,&rdquo; signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents &ldquo;removing gesture&rdquo; from the process.

Rationale: <p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the scholar&rsquo;s claim about Toni Morrison&rsquo;s likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s&mdash;during most of Morrison&rsquo;s time working there&mdash;than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House&rsquo;s published authors, thus supporting the scholar&rsquo;s claim. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company&rsquo;s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison&rsquo;s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn&rsquo;t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison&rsquo;s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar&rsquo;s claim focuses on Morrison&rsquo;s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison&rsquo;s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House. </p>"

The text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher&rsquo;s team found specimens of <em>S. caninervis</em> moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of <em>S. caninervis</em> specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that <em>S. caninervis</em> growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention another moss species besides <em>S. caninervis</em> or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as <em>S. caninervis</em> is.

This wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the moss&rsquo;s photosynthesis.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of <em>S. caninervis</em> specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn&rsquo;t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss. </p>"

If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren&rsquo;t able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers&rsquo; claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists&rsquo; work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model&rsquo;s accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models&rsquo; success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.&nbsp;</p>"

The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference. The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin&rsquo;s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to &ldquo;new analysis,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood. </p>"

The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as &ldquo;an old friend&rdquo; of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti&rsquo;s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti&rsquo;s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn&rsquo;t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti&rsquo;s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like &ldquo;an old friend&rdquo; to the woods, so she isn&rsquo;t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase &ldquo;as an old friend&rdquo; figuratively in reference to Shakti&rsquo;s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships. </p>"

The text indicates that some researchers believe &ldquo;Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.&rdquo; But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included &ldquo;valuable objects signaling a high position of power,&rdquo; which would raise the possibility that &ldquo;women may have also held leadership roles.&rdquo; Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;waive&rdquo; means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn&rsquo;t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect.

After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped find jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women&rsquo;s transition as their circumstances changed. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams&rsquo;s work as a political activist and writer for the <em>Chicago Defender</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women.

The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo&rsquo;s series <em>Reservation Dogs</em> focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television&rsquo;s general tendency regarding Native characters.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo&rsquo;s &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that Harjo &ldquo;proclaims,&rdquo; or declares or affirms, television&rsquo;s general tendency regarding Native characters.

At the start of the text, Jane says, &ldquo;I went on with my day&rsquo;s business tranquilly,&rdquo; indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is &ldquo;involuntarily framing advertisements&rdquo; (meaning that she can&rsquo;t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new &ldquo;situations&rdquo; (or jobs) would be like.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane&rsquo;s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall.

Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying.

Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she &ldquo;should&rdquo; quit her current job (indicating that she hasn&rsquo;t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts &ldquo;might germinate and bear fruit if they could,&rdquo; meaning that the thoughts haven&rsquo;t yet led to a decision&mdash;that Jane isn&rsquo;t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer&rsquo;s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>"

The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same&mdash;posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem.

Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it&rsquo;s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, the Tikal citadel&rsquo;s builders improved on it.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing &ldquo;precursors of&rdquo; Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuac&aacute;n. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, then the Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people&rsquo;s &ldquo;animosities toward,&rdquo; or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;</p>"

Text 1 describes Sharif&rsquo;s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively&mdash;that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others. </p>"

The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States.

The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur.

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text&rsquo;s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa&rsquo;s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees&rsquo; &ldquo;life-blood.&rdquo; Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees&mdash;their potential to give sap&mdash;that the women are evaluating. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention &ldquo;individual characters,&rdquo; this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees&rsquo; willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave. </p>"

Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta&rsquo;s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience \"efficiency gains\" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general.</p>"

The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France&rsquo;s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex.

Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team&rsquo;s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood.

Rationale: <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say &ldquo;[m]ore recently&rdquo; Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but &ldquo;that European breeds lack,&rdquo; which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira&rsquo;s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey&rsquo;s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues&rsquo; evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey&rsquo;s evidence is. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from &ldquo;1321&ndash;1407 CE&mdash;over a century before Europeans invaded the region&rdquo; and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey&rsquo;s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey&rsquo;s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.&nbsp;</p>"

Then the last sentence states that the house was &ldquo;wide open to the long-expected guest,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne&rsquo;s anticipation and Martha&rsquo;s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage.

The text begins by noting that Anne &ldquo;reveled in the world of color about her&rdquo;&mdash;that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped &ldquo;aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as &ldquo;messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne&rsquo;s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation.

Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne&rsquo;s personality. </p>"

Choice B is incorrect because if Vel&aacute;zquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense to say so in this context. </p>"

Rationale: <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that &ldquo;in fact, as many as half&rdquo; the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase &ldquo;in fact&rdquo; establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; or unavoidable.

There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was &ldquo;commonplace,&rdquo; or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view.&nbsp;</p>"
