A galaxy in a phase of rapid star formation is called a starburst galaxy. Quenching is a process in which a galaxy loses star-forming gas. A galaxy that no longer forms stars is called a quenched galaxy. A quenched galaxy has entered the post star burst phase.  \n\nThe student wants to explain what a quenched galaxy is. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?  \n\nA. Before quenching, a starburst galaxy will form stars at a rapid rate.  \n\nB. When it becomes quenched, a starburst galaxy enters the post star burst phase. C. Having entered the post star burst phase, a quenched galaxy is one that no longer forms stars. D. A starburst galaxy will lose star-forming gas and eventually become quenched.  \n\n\n"

This choice only describes what happens before quenching. Choice B is incorrect. This choice only describes what happens after quenching. Choice D is incorrect. This choice only describes what causes quenching.  \n\n\n"
